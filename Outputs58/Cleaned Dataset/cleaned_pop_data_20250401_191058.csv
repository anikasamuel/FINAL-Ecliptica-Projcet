The irrigation water needs of several plants are calculated by using various empirical equations based on meteorological data and the system is designed according to the month in which the highest irrigation water is needed. The aim of this study is to compare ETc of several crop calculated with different ETc estimation methods as FAO56-Penman-Monteith, Hergeaves - Samani and Radiation Equation with determined ETc values obtained from previously conducted research in Konya. In the study, five comonly cultivated crops in Konya Provience  such as maize, sugarbeet, sunflower, potato and wheat  were considered. In most of the cases, it was found that radiation equation produced higher ETc values than the measured ETc values in the researches conducted at the region. As a result of this study, Penman-Monteith was close to most of the values obtained from other studies and therefore remains a highly recommendable method for estimating ETc for considered plants in Konya",http://sjafs.selcuk.edu.tr/sjafs/article/download/1070/870,

In exploring whether crop rotation has the potential to improve soil carbon sequestration in China’s Loess Plateau, soil organic carbon (SOC), soil water content (SWC), soil bulk density (SBD), and soil pH were compared across the 0–1.0 m soil profile, under four crop rotation patterns: lentil–wheat–maize, wheat–potato–lentil, wheat–maize–potato, and wheat–flax–pea. The lentil–wheat–maize and wheat–maize–potato rotations have been practiced over the past 20 years, while the wheat–potato–lentil and wheat–flax–pea rotations were established in 1978 (~40 year rotations). The results showed that under the 20-year lentil–wheat–maize rotation, SOC was not significantly different to that of the wheat–maize–potato rotation, at 6.81 g kg−1 and 6.91 g kg−1, respectively. However, under the lentil–wheat–maize rotation, SWC (9.81%) and SBD (1.19 Mg m−3) were significantly higher, but soil pH (8.42) was significantly lower than the same metrics under wheat–maize–potato rotation (8.43% and 1.16 Mg m−3, and 8.50, respectively). For the 40-year rotations, SWC (9.19%) and soil pH (8.41) under the wheat–potato–lentil were not significantly different to that of the wheat–flax–pea (8.87%, and 8.40, respectively). SOC (6.06 g kg−1) was significantly lower, but SBD (1.18 Mg m−3) was significantly higher under the wheat–potato–lentil than the wheat–flax–pea (7.29 g kg−1, and 1.15 Mg m−3, respectively) rotations. Soil carbon sequestration for the lentil–wheat–maize and wheat–potato–lentil rotations was co-influenced by SWC, SBD, and soil pH, while for wheat–maize–potato and wheat–flax–pea rotations, it was co-influenced by SWC and soil pH. The economic value of the four studied crops is, in order: potato > maize > wheat > flax. The results of the present study suggest that the lentil–wheat–maize and maize–flax–pea rotations are the most suitable patterns to optimize simultaneous economic and ecological development of the study area.",https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4395/10/2/160/pdf?version=1580631342,

The study aims to classify the soils, mapping the land capability and suitability according to different local and international systems and compare those systems for agriculture to set the optimum land utilization planning. Visual interpretations of Landsat-8 OLI image with information obtained from ground truth data and soil survey have been used to map the soils under investigation in terms of American taxonomy system. Five land evaluation systems were applied; USDA Land Capability Classification (USDA-NRCS, 2005), Land capability classification for irrigated agriculture (Sys and Verhey, 1978), Micro LEIS (De la Rosa et al., 2004), Applied System for Land Evaluation (Ismail et al., 2001) and Land suitability classification for certain crops (Sys et al., 1991a, b and 1993). Results reveal that El Moghra soils could be distinguished into four sub great soil groups, namely; Typic Torripsamments (63.1%), Typic Torriorthents (9.8%), Typic Haplosalids (22.7%) and Calcic Haplosalids (4.4%). With regard to the land capability, the study indicated that El Moghra soils are mostly belonging to class III (86.6%) and the rest of the area follows class II (13.4%) according to the USDA LCC, whilst the soils are shared by the marginal (S3) and currently not suitable lands (N1) according to Sys and Verhey (1978). By applying the Micro LEIS, it was found that about 68.7% of the total area belongs to moderate class, while 31.3% of the area is a part of marginal class. Also, the study indicated that the area is almost not suitable (C6) for agriculture according to ASLE system. With respect to the soil suitability for certain crops, 30 crops were tested and the results showed that there are three levels according to priority of utilization: first priority for crops (Panicum, Jojobe, Jatropha Olive, Fig, Date Palm, Cotton, Sun Flower, Barley, Wheat and Sugar Beet), second priority for crops (Sorghum, Grape, Water Melon, Sugar Cane, Cabbage, Alfalfa, and Potato, Tomato and Maize) and a third priority for crops (Pepper, Rice, Pea, Peanut, Soya Bean, Faba Bean, Onion, Apple, Banana and Citrus). According to ASLE and Micro LEIS, the coarse texture, high calcium carbonate content and alkalinity are the main constrains affecting soil suitability for agriculture. Panicum, Jojobe and Jatropha are introduced to be grown in the studied area as these plants can grow in marginal soils and proved to sustain in desert land.",https://doi.org/10.36632/mejar/2021.10.4.92,

The review revealed that the agronomic researches at IAAS from 2000 to 2012 were concentrated mostly in on-station farm of Rampur, Chitwan and found their focus on 11 food grain crops with five major themes viz. varietal evaluation, crop management, soil nutrient and weeds management, and crop simulation modeling. With the shifting of IAAS PG program from Rampur to Kirtipur in 2013, the major agronomic researches were found to be concentrated in on-farm stations due to transitional movement of IAAS to Agriculture and Forestry University, Nepal. A total of 115 agronomic studies were conducted on various crops, of which 92 were on cereals, 8 on legumes, oilseed and minor cereals including potato. There were records of 10 studies on rice-wheat and 3 studies on maize-based systems. The huge gaps between the potential and farmers' field yield and between the potential and research station yields for rice, maize and wheat crops suggested a great scope to raise yields of cereals by improved agronomical researches on varieties evaluation, crop and nutrient management and weed management. Simulation modeling study predicted that the varieties of rice and maize adopted at present could sustain the yields only for recent few years and needed for introduction of new climate resilient varieties, then after. Innovative and new researches on eco-region suited on-farm trails with variety identification, improved crop husbandry and soil nutrient management, improved weed and water management and on agro-meteorology, conservation agriculture, climate change adaptation and crop simulation modeling are advised as future research frontiers to uplift the productivity and reduce yield gaps of major food crops and to strengthen the academics of post-graduate research in near future.",https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/janr/article/download/22225/18952,

Totally 22 of the obtained strains caused soft rot on potato slices in pectolytic activity tests and showed positive results in pathogenicity tests on maize seedlings. Morphological, physiological and biochemical tests, MALDI-TOF and PCR tests were used to identify the strains and the strains were compatible with Dickeya zeae. The strains showed a high match with the CFBP-2052 coded Dickeya zeae isolate found in the MALDI TOF library with 2.264; 2.332; 2.339; 2.364 and 2.365 score values. In the PCR test using the ADE1/ADE2 primer pair, all of our strains were identified as Dickeya zeae by forming bands of 420 bp.Conclusions: In the study, the stalk rot disease caused by Dickeya zeae was observed for the first time in maize fields in Adana and Osmaniye provinces. Therefore, it is necessary to take precautions with cultural measures against the disease, which has no chemical control. So, the use of healthy and certified seeds, drip irrigation instead of wild or sprinkler irrigation, removal of all diseased plant residues from the fields, and increasing the microbial activity of the soil by beneficial microorganisms are important strategies in the management of the disease.Significance and Impact of the Study: Dickeya zeae causal agent of bacterial stalk rot disease of maize has been isolated and identified from diseased plants such as symptoms of water-soak appearance, browning, softening, rotting, unpleasant odour and collapse of the stalks in Adana and Osmaniye provinces.",https://dergipark.org.tr/tr/download/article-file/2441701,

This study investigated a large number of studies in film mulching fields from the past 10 years (mostly from 2019 to 2023) and summarized the impact of plastic film mulching, progress in modeling with film mulching, and future research directions. The effects of plastic film mulching were intricate and were influenced by film mulching methods, irrigation systems, crop types, crop growth stages, etc. Overall, plastic film mulching showed a positive effect on improving soil water, temperature, and nitrogen status, enhancing crop transpiration and photosynthetic rates, and promoting crop growth and yield, although film mulching may have negative effects, such as increasing rainfall interception, blocking water entering the soil, and reducing net radiation income. The crop yield and water use efficiency could increase by 39.9–84.7% and 45.3–106.4% under various film mulching methods. Coupled models of soil water and heat transport and crop growth under plastic film mulching conditions have been established by considering the effects of plastic film mulching on the upper boundary conditions of soil water and heat, energy budget and distribution processes, and the exchange of latent and sensible heat between soil and atmosphere. The models have good applicability in film mulched farmland of maize, rice, and potato for different regions of China. Further development is needed for soil water, heat, nitrogen migration, and crop growth models under different plastic film mulching methods, and the acquisition of soil and crop indicators under plastic film mulching conditions based on big data support.

However, the identification and function of the T6SS effectors remains only partly known. Pantoea ananatis, a gram‐negative bacterium, is commonly found in various plants and natural environments, including water and soil. In the current study, genomic analysis of P. ananatis DZ‐12 causing brown stalk rot on maize demonstrated that it carries three T6SS gene clusters, namely, T6SS‐1, T6SS‐2, and T6SS‐3. Interestingly, only T6SS‐1 secretion systems are involved in pathogenicity and bacterial competition. The study also investigated the T6SS‐1 system in detail and identified an unknown T6SS‐1‐secreted effector TseG by using the upstream T6SS effector chaperone TecG containing a conserved domain of DUF2169. TseG can directly interact with the chaperone TecG for delivery and with a downstream immunity protein TsiG for protection from its toxicity. TseG, highly conserved in the Pantoea genus, is involved in virulence in maize, potato, and onion. Additionally, P. ananatis uses TseG to target Escherichia coli, gaining a competitive advantage. This study provides the first report on the T6SS‐1‐secreted effector from P. ananatis, thereby enriching our understanding of the various types and functions of type VI effector proteins.",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/mpp.13442,

The characterization of adverse weather and the quantification of their potential impact on arable farming is necessary to advise farmers on feasible and effective adaptation strategies and to support decision making in the agriculture sector. This research aims to analyze the impact of adverse weather on the yield of winter wheat, grain maize and late potato using a yield gap approach. A time-series analysis was performed to identify the relationship between (agro-)meteorological indicators and crop yields and yield gaps in Flanders (northern Belgium) based on 10 years of field trial and weather data. Indicators were calculated for different crop growth stages and multiple soils. Indicators related to high temperature, water deficit and water excess were analyzed, as the occurrence frequency and intensity of these weather events will most likely increase by 2030–2050. The concept of “yield gap” was used to analyze the effects of adverse weather in relation to other yield-reducing factors such as suboptimal management practices. Winter wheat preferred higher temperatures during grain filling and was negatively affected by wet conditions throughout the growing season. Maize was especially vulnerable to drought throughout the growing season. Potato was more affected by heat and drought stress during tuber bulking and by waterlogging during the early growth stages.

Starch is widely used as thickener, water binder, emulsion stabilizer, and gelling agent. Each starch granule typically contains amylopectin, a linear chain of (1→4)-α-D-glucose residues connected through branched (1→6)-α-linkages, and a much larger number of the smaller amylose, α(1→4) linearly linked D-glucopyranosyl residues.Amylose is a hydrocolloid. Its extended conformation causes the high viscosity of water-soluble starch which varies relatively little with temperature. The extended loosely helical chains possess a relatively hydrophobic inner surface that is not able to hold water. Amylose forms useful gels and ﬁlms. Its association and crystallization (retrogradation) on cooling and storage decrease storage stability, causing shrinkage and the release of water (syneresis). Increasing amylose concentration decreases gel stickiness, but increases gel ﬁrmness. Amylopectin interferes with the interaction between amylose chains (and retrogradation) and its solution can lead to an initial loss in viscosity and followed by a more slimy consistency.The simplest and most common starch modiﬁcation is by acid hydrolysis, which is widely used in food, paper, textile, and pharmaceutical industries.",http://www.scielo.cl/pdf/jcchems/v53n3/art02.pdf,

Crop rotations can be applied to the new lands using water savings including (wheat and maize), with an area ranging from 2048 to 2399 thousand feddans, and including (wheat and summer and nili vegetables), with an area ranging from 2941 to 3444 thousand acres, also including (maize, winter and nili vegetables), with an area ranging from 3432 to 4021 thousand feddans. With regard to the impact of reducing the area of water crops to water gap which reached about 20.9 billion m3, it decreased by about 2.879, 2.758, 2.800 billion m3, which make water gap decreased to about 18.02, 18.14, 18.10 billion m3, with change rate of about 3.77, 3.61, 3.66%, for statistical models respectively, while the results of the second scenario show decreased of about 3.013, 2.572, 2.681 billion m3, which make water gap decreased to about 17.89, 18.33, 18.22 billion m3, with change rate of about 3.94, 3.37 and 3.51% for statistical models respectively. The research recommends the following points: 1. Reduce the areas of rice, sugar cane and alfalfa to save a quantity of water ranging between 2.572 3.013 billion m3 of land within the valley. 2. Using of water savings resulting from reducing the areas of water crops to expand the cultivation of new land with strategic and monetary crops. 3. Sugar beet area can be expanded at least to the extent that it covers the shortage of sugar production caused by reducing the sugar cane area, then taking into account and study the effects resulting from that. 4. Modification of cropping patern structure to be in accordance with the local, regional, environmental situations that may affect current and future water availability.",https://ajs.journals.ekb.eg/article_13636_177499b03169a1d6564c413b8f557716.pdf,

Currently, various regulations require industry to measure and quantify the emissions generated from its process activity. LCA is a method that can be used to analyze and report the environmental impact of an activity that uses resources and generates waste by an industrial activity. In this work, LCA is used to determine the environmental impact of a semi-mechanical extraction process of sago industry. The data was collected through the sago industry in Cimahpar, Bogor. The extraction of sago starch consists of stem cutting, rasping, mixing, filtration, starch sedimentation, washing, and drying. The scope of LCA study covers the harvesting of sago stem, transportation to extraction site, and the starch extraction process. With the assumption that the average transportation distance of sago stem to extraction site is 200 km, the GHG emission is estimated to be 325 kg CO2 eq / ton of sundried sago starch. This figure is lower than that reported for maize starch (1120 kg CO2 eq), potato starch (2232 kg CO2 eq) and cassava starch (4310 kg CO2 eq). This is most likely due to the uncounted impact from the use of electrical energy on the extraction process, which is currently being conducted. A follow-up study is also underway to formulate several process improvement scenarios to derive the design of sago starch processing that generates the minimum emissions.",https://doi.org/10.1088/1755-1315/147/1/012036,

Hydrological processes in agricultural soils are strongly affected by rooting depth and root distribution. We present a new approach to monitor and model root dynamics and its influence on soil moisture using minirhizotrons combined with phenological observations. Field setups consist of a portable root scanner and acrylic glass tubes installed in the soil at the start of the growing season. 360° scans of soil and roots are taken regularly at different depths in the tubes. Root traits are identified automatically for each soil layer and complemented by observations of aboveground plant phenology. Results from minirhizotron data collected at an agrometeorological observatory in Germany show for both cereal and rapeseed (Brassica napus L.) crops a higher root density in deeper soil layers and a lower density near the soil surface when compared to literature data. An opposite picture emerged for maize (Zea mays L.) and potato (Solanum tuberosum L.), whereas vertical root distribution in sugar beet (Beta vulgaris subsp. vulgaris) had a different seasonal course than expected from literature. Applying the new root distribution data in calculations of the soil water balance resulted in differences of more than 3% in absolute volumetric soil water content. A comparison with in situ measurements of volumetric soil moisture at 20‐ and 50‐cm depth revealed a significant improvement of the model results due to the new parameterization. Thus, we argue that minirhizotrons constitute a useful supplement to hydrological observatories and can help understand and predict soil moisture dynamics in the critical zone.",https://doi.org/10.1002/vzj2.20382,

The area is being reclaimed now to be a link between EL-Dakhla and Abu Mnqar Oases western Desert of Egypt. The present study aims to identify the physiographic futures and evaluating the agricultural potentiality of the soils in the study area to determine the most appropriate land use. To achieve this objective Sentinel 2 images, digital elevation model and data limited to land surveying were used for delineating the region's main physiographic units in the study area are plateau (( pL 11)), Bajada (P13), Solutional depression (P12), Pedi plain (P11), Sand sheets (P21), and sand dunes (P22). Sixteen soil profiles plus a number of auger observations and 120 minipits were selected to represent the different mapping units.

Crop productivity depends on quality of input supply including seeds, fertilizers, pesticides and supported by irrigation facilities. In India, ground water irrigates more than 61% of net cropped area and much of water being used for irrigating rice crop. The disproportionate water uses for crop production results in poor water productivity. The planning of water resources could be achieved by knowing the crop water requirements in different seasons and productivity of water. Hence, study was taken up to assess the water use and productivity of crops under intensively ground water irrigated watershed.Methods: A study conducted to assess the water use and productivity of different crops grown in Kothakunta sub watershed (having 206 working bore wells with cultivated area of 203.5 ha) in Siddipet district of Telangana, India during kharif and rabi season of 2008 to 2012, data were collected from 147 farmers on rice, maize, cotton, potato, flora beans and tomato crops grown under irrigation. The water applied to crops was measured by fixing water meters at the end of water delivery pipe and recorded the quantity of water applied each time. For rice crop four plots were taken and for other crops two plots were taken for measuring the water. The water use and productivity were assessed by using standard procedure. Result: The water productivity was found to be higher to vegetables, which ranged between 2.43 kg of potato, 1.57 kg of beans and 1.26 kg of tomato than cereals (0.79 kg for maize and 0.39 kg for rabi rice) per cubic meter of irrigation water consumed. Water productivity in terms of monetary return (₹) per cubic meter of water consumed was higher with beans (₹ 17.20) in contrast to potato (₹ 16.12).

This paper describes analyses of different soil water flow regimes on growth and yields of grass, maize and potato crops in the Dutch delta, with a focus on the role of capillary rise. Different flow regimes are characterised by differences in soil composition and structure are derived from a national soil database. Capillary rise and its influence on crop growth and resulting yields is simulated using Swap-Wofost with different boundary conditions. Case studies and model experiments are used to illustrate the impact of capillary rise. This impact is clearly present in situations where a groundwater level is present (85 % of NL) but also in other situations the impact of capillary rise on crop growth and production is considerable. When one compares situations with average groundwater levels with free drainage conditions without capillary rise yield-reductions of grassland, maize and potatoes are respectively 25, 4 and 15 % or respectively about 3.2, 0.5 and 1.6 ton dry Matter per ha. Neglecting capillary rise also has impact on the downward leaching water flux, the groundwater recharge.

It will be necessary to raise biomass production and economic yield per unit of land—not only under optimum growing conditions, but even more under conditions constrained by climate, water availability, and soil quality. Most of the advanced agronomic research by national and international research institutes is dedicated to the major food crops: maize, rice, wheat, and potato. However, research on crops grown as feedstock, for bio-energy and industrial use under conditions with biophysical constraints, is lagging behind. Global and regional assessments of the potential for growing crops are mostly based on model and explorative studies under optimum conditions, or with either water or nitrogen deficiencies. More investments in combined experimental and modeling research are needed to develop and evaluate new crops and cropping systems under a wide range of agro-ecological conditions.

Nitisols are among the most extensive agricultural soils in the Ethiopian highlands but soil degradation threatens their productive capacity. In this study, the effects of two land use systems, intensive cereal and agroforestry systems, and slope class on physical and chemical characteristics of some Nitisol profiles were investigated. In total 12 sample profiles were described and soil samples were collected from each of the identified master horizon. Soil physical characteristics evaluated were particle size distribution, structural aggregate stability, water holding capacity and bulk density. Chemical characteristics determined were exchangeable bases and cation exchange capacity, soil pH and the contents of organic carbon (OC), total nitrogen (TN), available phosphorus (AP) and some micronutrients.ResultsAmong the physical characteristics, land use and slope significantly (p < 0.05) affected particle size distribution and plant available water content. The mean sand (28%) and silt (26%) particles in the intensive cereal system were significantly (p < 0.05) higher compared to 15% sand and 18% silt in the agroforestry system. Conversely, the mean values of fine grained texture materials including 39% fine sand, 42% fine silt and 67% clay in the agroforestry system were significantly higher than 30% fine sand, 21% fine silt and 46% clay in the cereal system. Similarly, the lower slope had significantly (p < 0.05) higher fin texture materials (39% fine sand, 30% fine silt, and 63%) clay) compared to 17% fine sand, 14% fine silt and 51% clay fractions in the upper slope. The proportion of water stable aggregate (WSA) were highlight (63–94%) and there was no significant difference between land types and slope classes. Following from high structural aggregate stability, the soils have high water holding capacity that ranged from 22 to 32% at PWP to 34–49% at FC while plant available water content (AWC) was in the 120–230 mm m−1 range. Considering the chemical characteristics, land use significantly affected soil pH, total nitrogen (TN), exchangeable magnesium (Mg2+), potassium (K+), percent base saturation (PBS), and available micro nutrients—iron (Fe2+), manganese (Mn2+) and zinc (Zn2+). The mean pH value (5.29) in the intensive cereal system strongly acidic while the pH value for the agroforestry system (6.12) was taken moderately acidic. The mean OC content was 2.0 and 2.1% for the intensive cereal and agroforestry systems that were rated very low. The mean TN values were 0.15 and 0.22% for intensive cereal and agroforestry systems that were taken as low to very low. Similarly the mean values for AP were 8 and 10 mg kg−1 for cereal and agroforestry systems that were rated low. On the other hand, the CEC, exchangeable bases (Ca2+, Mg2+, K+) and PBS of the soil were rated high while Na+ appeared only in trace amount, and there was no significant difference between land use type and slope classes except for Mg2+, K+ and PBS. Mean values of Mg2+ and K+ (15 and 3 cmol(+) kg−1) and PBS (75%) in the agroforestry system were significantly higher than those in the cereal system (6 and 1.6 cmol(+) kg−1 of Mg2+ and K+ and 51% PBS). Among micronutrients, land use significantly (p < 0.05) affected available Fe2+, Mn2+ and Zn+. The mean values of Fe2+ (97 mg kg−1) and Mn2+ (68 mg kg−1) in the agroforestry system were taken as excessively high while they were moderately sufficient (37, 39 mg kg−1, respectively) in the cereal system. Slope effects were significant for OC, TN and AP having higher mean values (2.5% OC, 0.22% TN and 17 mg kg−1 AP) in the lower slope than in the upper slope (1.5% OC, 0.13% TN and 8 mg kg−1 AP).ConclusionLand use and slope had significant effect on some soil physical and chemical characteristics. The land use practices in the intensive cereal system are adversely affecting important soil characteristics as compared to the soil under the agroforestry system. These include alteration of particle size distribution, strongly acidic soil reaction, organic matter and nutrient depletion (N, P, K and Zn) and low plant available water content. Among the inappropriate land use practices include repeated cultivation to create fine seedbed that predisposes the soil to erosion, unbalanced fertilizer application, rotation of maize with potato that are depleting soil nutrient stocks (e., K and Zn), and removal of crop residues from fields. Therefore, a more balanced fertilizer blend application that contain N, P, K and Zn combined with liming to raise soil pH, organic matter management and integrated soil water conservation are recommended.",https://environmentalsystemsresearch.springeropen.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s40068-017-0097-2,

The bioavailability of Zn and Fe in the beverage were also assessed using phytate, Zn, Ca and Fe molar ratios. Processing of sorghum into kunu-zaki significantly (p<0.05) increased its ash (26.32 %), Na (21.28 %), Ca (20.59 %), Fe (21.62 %), Zn (13.43 %), flavonoids (11.11 %) and alkaloids (30.00 %) contents, but decreased its protein (-43.75 %), fiber (-28.57 %), phenols (-43.80 %), saponin (-62.6 7%), tannin (-43.80 %), oxalate (-33.33 %) and phytate (-60.27 %) contents. Addition of sweet potato paste to kunu-zaki apparently aided in enhancing its chemical composition. The combination of germination and fermentation as processing techniques were better than germination alone in significantly (p<0.05) improving the bioavailability of Fe and Zn, and reducing the anti-nutrient content of kunu-zaki, in comparison with both raw and germinated sorghum grains. In conclusion, the kunu-zaki had low contents of protein and fiber, adequate arrays of other functional nutrients and potentially high bioavailability of Fe and Zn. 1.0 Introduction Kunu-zaki is an African traditional non-alcoholic beverage that has been popular in Nigeria for decades. It is produced by traditional fermentation of cereal grains by beneficial microbes, and has been widely known for its high acceptability, palatability and energy replenishing potentials, which is claimed to be related to its rich content of various functional components. Kunu-zaki, a product of lactic acid fermentation [1], is commonly prepared locally by women, and taken mainly by low and middle income earners for its thirst quenching and energy-giving properties. It is also used locally for entertainment at homes and during festivities such as Sallah and Christmas ceremonies [2]. Depending on the major cereal used in kunu-zaki production, the common types of the beverage include kunun zaki, kunun gyada, kunun akamu, kunun tsamiya and kunun baule [3]. Although, cereals can be used in composite form in the production of kunu-zaki, sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) and millet (Pennisetum americanum) grains are the most commonly used raw materials [2]. However, maize (Zea mays), rice, acha (Digitaria exilis), guinea corn and other grains may also be used [1]. The traditional production process involves steeping of the chosen cereal or mixture of the cereals in water for 24 – 72 hours and wet milling with the aid of a local grinding machine. The steeped and washed grains are usually ground with species such as ginger, clove, red and/or black pepper depending on the taste of the local producer. The slurry obtained is sieved and divided into two unequal portions. A potion (two-third volume) of the slurry is gelatinized with boiling hot water, while to the remaining portion (one-third volume), about an equal volume of sweet potato (Ipomonea batatas) tuber paste, malted rice paste or extract of Cadaba farinose stem is added and mixed. The latter mixture is mixed vigorously and thoroughly with the former, the gelatinized portion while still hot, and allowed to ferment for 24 hours at room temperature. After which, it is International Journal of Pharmacology, Phytochemistry and Ethnomedicine Submitted: 2016-03-19 ISSN: 2297-6922, Vol. 3, pp 9-19 Accepted: 2016-05-17 doi:10.18052/www.scipress.com/IJPPE.3.9 Online: 2016-06-30 CC BY 4.0.

The beverage can be consumed fresh or bottled and stored at refrigeration temperature [2,4,5]. Cereal grains and their different products form the major source of dietary nutrients for many people, especially those in the developing countries of the world. However, it has been reported that the nutritional quality of cereal grains and their products are inferior due to lower protein content, deficiency of certain essential amino acids, lower protein and starch availabilities, presence of certain anti-nutrients and the coarse nature of the grains [6]. In line with the above report, kunu-zaki has been noted to have a gross chemical composition of 87.85 – 89 % moisture, 9.84 – 12 % carbohydrate, 1.56 – 3 % protein, 0.10 – 0.30 % fat and 0.61 – 0.75 % ash, indicating that the drink is low in protein [2]. Furthermore, like other cereal based products, kunu-zaki may contain high amounts of anti-nutrient that may affect nutrient availability. Anti-nutrients found in cereals, such as phytate, can decrease the absorption of minerals such as Zn, Ca, Fe and Mn, and high intake of these anti-nutrients might lead to mineral deficiency. Zinc and iron are essential trace elements in human nutrition, whose deficiencies are among the common nutritional problems affecting the world. Their deficiencies are of major concern because of the serious health consequences they have, as well as the large number of people afflicted; especially in developing countries of the world. These deficiencies may be caused by the presence of certain anti-nutrients, especially the ability of phytate to reduce dietary Zn and Fe bioavailability by formation of insoluble mineral chelates at physiological pH. The formation and stability of these chelates depend on the relative concentrations of Zn, Fe and phytate as well as on the levels of dietary Ca present [7,8]. However, certain traditional food processing techniques, either individually or in combination, such as germination, steeping, fermentation, and boiling of grains for a limited period have been reported to cause increased activities of hydrolytic enzymes, improvement in the contents of certain essential amino acids, total sugars, B-group vitamins, and a decrease in dry matter, starch and anti-nutrients [9]. Thus, the present study is aimed at determining the effect of fermentation and germination, and the addition of sweet potato tuber paste on the chemical composition and bioavailability of Zn and Fe in kunu-zaki drink. 2.0 Materials and Methods 2.1 Collection of materials The sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) grains and fresh sweet potato (Ipomonea batatas) tubers were purchased from Mami-Market, Obinze in Owerri-West Local Government Area of Imo State, and authenticated at the Department of Crop Science, Federal University of Technology, Owerri, Nigeria. 2.2 Laboratory Production of Kunu-zaki The Kunu-zaki was produced by a modified method (Figure 1), based on the traditional method of production as described by [2,5]. In brief, 500 g of apparently healthy sorghum grains were washed and steeped in 1000 ml of water for 24 hours at room temperature (30 0 C). The steeped grains were drained of water, covered with moist paper-bag for 72 hours at room temperature for germination. Visible root portions of germinated grains were manually removed. After which, they were wet milled using Kenwood major blender (Model Titanium KM020, Kenwood Chef Major, Giovanni, UK) and sieved with a muslin cloth to obtain a slurry. The paste was then divided into two unequal (two-third and one-third) portions. To the larger portion, 3 liters of boiling hot water was added and turned vigorously until a gelatinized paste was obtained. To the smaller portion, 10 g of washed and ground fresh sweet potato paste was added. The gelatinized sample was allowed to cool to about 50 0 C, and the later mixture was added to it and stirred vigorously but thoroughly for about 5 min. The combined mixture was covered with paper-bag, allowed to ferment for 12 hours and then filtered with the aid of a cloth sieve to obtain an un-sweetened kunu-zaki. 10 IJPPE Volume 3",https://www.scipress.com/IJPPE.3.9.pdf,

However, supplementation of breast milk starts too early, thereby exposing the infants to diarrhoea and other infections. Despite the recom-mendation of the World Health Organization (WHO) of exclusive breastfeeding (EB) from birth to six months, EB is rare and poorly timed and complementary feeding (CF) practices are still common. The study describes feeding practices of children aged 0 to 24 months in the Mumias Division of the Kakamega district in Kenya. Method Using a cross-sectional study, 180 mothers of infants/children were interviewed using a structured questionnaire. Data on socio-demographic characteristics, feeding practices and sources of information on the same were obtained from the mothers. Results Whereas 92.1% of the children were breastfed, only 12.2% of the mothers practiced EB up to 4 to 6 months. Mothers introduced liquids and complementary foods at a mean age of 2.7 months and by the fourth month, more than one-third (34.5%) of the mothers had initiated CF. Apart from water, fresh milk, tea, commercial juices, maize-meal/millet porridge, mashed potatoes, bananas and fruits were also introduced. The perceived reasons for introducing these foods included the child being old enough (33.8%), another pregnancy (25%), insufficient milk (20.3%), sickness of the mother or child (10.5%) and in order for the child to eat other foods (11.4%). Over half (53.3%) of the mothers obtained information on BF and CF from friends, neighbours, media advertisements and health workers. Conclusion Breastfeeding is common; however, mothers do not seem to practice the WHO recom-mendations. Mothers in this study area and other rural communities need to be empowered with information on the correct BF and CF practices through existing government health services, non-governmental organisations and other community-based networks, especially in the light of the HIV/AIDS pandemic.",https://phcfm.org/index.php/phcfm/article/download/15/15,

This paper reviews the impacts of climate change on fourteen strategic crops for eight sub-Saharan Africa countries. Climate change is projected to increase median temperature by 1.4–5.5°C and median precipitation by −2% to 20% by the end of the 21st century. However, large levels of uncertainty exist with temporal and spatial variability of rainfall events. The impact of climate change on crop yields in the region is largely negative. Among the grain crops, wheat is reported as the most vulnerable crop, for which up to 72% of the current yield is projected to decline. For other grain crops, such as maize, rice and soybean, up to 45% yield reductions are expected by the end of this century. Two grain crops, millet and sorghum, are more resilient to climate change for which projected impacts on crop yields are <20%. Root crops, such as sweet potato, potato and cassava are projected to be less affected than the grain crops with changes to crop yields ranging from about −15% to 10%. For the two major export crops, tea and coffee, up to 40% yield loss is expected due to the reduction in suitable areas caused by temperature increase. Similar loss of suitable areas is also expected for banana and sugarcane production, however, this reduction is due to rainfall variability in lowland areas. Other crops such as cotton and sugarcane are projected to be more susceptible to precipitation variation that will vary significantly in the region. In order to mitigate the long-term impacts of climate change on agricultural sectors, the development of small-scale irrigation systems and water harvesting structures seems promising, however, affordability of such measures remains a key issue.",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/fes3.61,

The aim of the research is to estimate the economic viability of the production of maize, potatoes and tomatoes in terms of FI (full irrigation). The assessment of the economic viability of the application of the irrigation system when it comes to maize and potato production is done on the basis of a comparative analysis of the realized proft in the natural water regime and FI, whereas in the case of greenhouse tomato production it is done on the basis of comparative analysis of proft achieved in terms of RDI (regulated defcit irrigation) and FI. The research results indicate a positive economic effect of the irrigation system implementation because in our climate the water needs of a culture cannot be satisfed solely by precipitation, and thus water defcit occurs. This lack of rainfall causes yield reduction because it is the main parameter which increases the production proftability.

The compressional, mechanical and dissolution properties were analyzed using density, crushing strength and dissolution methods. The result obtained showed that tablets made with ginger starch had acceptable crushing strength and dissolution rate. The disintegration time for 2%, 4% and 6% w/w ginger starch were 22.25, 17.07 and 33.17 minutes respectively and that for cassava starch 34.24, 29.16 and 33.35 minutes respectively. The 2% w/w of the ginger and cassava starches did not fall within the standard limit of the hardness test (4–8 kg) but rather values of 8.55 kg and 8.45 kg respectively were obtained and this may be linked to the thresh hold of the concentration of the binder not being attained. All the formulations passed the qualitative analysis but that consisting of 4% w/w ginger starch performed excellently in the entire tests hence ginger starch of such concentration could be a very suitable excipient for ibuprofen tablet formulation as compared to cassava starch of the same percentage composition. Key-words: Ginger, Cassava, Ibuprofen, Starch, Tablet, Natural biodegradable biopolymer INTRODUCTION Binders as agents impart cohesive qualities to powdered material during the production of tablet. They impact such properties to the tablet formulation by ensuring that the tablet remains intact after compression as well as improving free powder flowing quality . Binders have been used as solutions and in dry form depending on nature of another ingredient in the formulation and method of preparation. The choice of a particular binding agent depends on the binding force required, compatibility with other ingredients, particularly the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) . Important materials commonly used as binders are starch, gelatin, natural gum, sugar, acacia, polyethylene glycol, water etc .

Starch as one of the most abundant organic chemicals on earth is found in the leaves of green plants and on the plastids where it is synthesized from seeds, roots, and tubers of most plants serving as the chemical storage form of energy . Starch is a natural biodegradable biopolymer which has wide industrial application, a quantitatively important digestible polysaccharide regarded as nutritionally superior to low molecular weight carbohydrate or sugar .Maize and potato starch has been in common use and recently cassava starch . Another type of starch currently under study is ginger starch as a binder in the pharmaceutical industry. The type and binder concentration could impart a direct effect on tablet properties such as crushing strength, friability, disintegration and tablet dissolution. Ginger (Zingiber officinale) is an herbaceous perennial plant belonging to the order scitaminaceae and family Zingiberaceae. Harvest of natural ginger is determined by the age of the leaves and bulb size and it contains such compounds as starch, fat, gingerol and volatile oil. The starch is mainly used as an indicator, the excipient in Research Article Int. J. Life Sci. Scienti.

Cassava (Manihot esculenta) is a perennial shrub with an edible root which grows in tropical and sub-tropical areas of the world. Cassava is propagated by stem cutting [8] and the major constituent is starch especially from the cassava tuber and this starch is often recommended for use in extruded snacks for improved expansion. The cassava starch is also used as a thickener in food not subjected to rigorous processing condition. It is very bland in flavor hence used in processed baby foods and as a filer material and binding agents in the confectionary industry . Ibuprofen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAIDs), a first member of the propionic acid derivative which occurs as a white powder or crystals with a characteristic odor. Fig. 1: Chemical structure of Ibuprofen Ibuprofen is soluble in aqueous solution of alkali hydroxide and carbonate but slightly soluble in water and has a melting point of about 76°C . Ibuprofen has a prominent analgesic and anti-pyretic effect, which is due to the inhibitory action on cyclooxygenases involved in the synthesis of prostaglandin that plays important role in the production of pain, fever, and inflammation . Ibuprofen is well absorbed orally, peak serum concentration is reached within 1–2 hours after drug administration and the drug is eliminated within 24 hours after the last dose through metabolism. The dose of ibuprofen for an adult is 1.2 g daily in divided doses, while that for children is 20 mg/kg body weight daily, but not above 500mg for children with weight less than 30kg, as overdose may lead to toxicity. such as acute renal failure, aplastic anaemia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. Ibuprofen decreases the effect of aspirin by blocking the active site of platelet cyclo-oxygenase, hence it should be administered 8 hours before aspirin, or at least 2–4 hours after aspirin. Ibuprofen is available in the following dosage forms as tablet, capsules, chewable tablets, and oral suspension and usually manufactured as 200 mg or 400 mg ibuprofen in a tablet and 100 mg/50 mg in oral suspension and it should be taken after a meal because it can lead to damage of stomach or intestinal lining, if taken before a meal. Tablets are solid preparation each containing a single dose of one or more active ingredients and usually obtained by compressing uniform volumes of particles. It is the most popular dosage form in existence among all dosage forms because of the convenience of selfadministration, chemical and physical stability, cheapness, versatile way of use and delivery, compactness and ease of manufacturing . Certain numbers of chemically inert materials known as adjunct or excipients are added to the active pharmaceutical ingredient and their classification is based on their processing functions and finished products such as binders, lubricants, glidants, disintegrants, etc. Such excipients should be bound with certain quality criteria as nontoxic, physiologically inert, relatively cheap and acceptable to regulating agencies in all countries . The aim of this study is to evaluate and compare the binding activity of extracted ginger and cassava starch on ibuprofen tablet formulation.

This process can cause losses of valuable top soil material, water resources for plant availability, and nutrients as well as transport of plant protection products (PPP) into adjacent surface water bodies. In the European and the US risk assessment for the registration of PPP, runoff and erosion are numerically calculated with the simulation model PRZM which uses the USDA runoff curve number (CN) concept for the water movement. Results from runoff field trials were used to estimate the effect of dedicated management practices in terms of mitigating runoff and erosion, i.e. creating micro-dams between the ridges of potato fields or in maize cultivation on model input parameters. Results Application of different cultivation and tillage techniques (micro-dams/bunds) showed a consistent decrease of the measured quantities of runoff, erosion, and PPP transport as well as of the calculated CN and predicted environmental concentrations in surface water. The results presented here support the approach to quantitatively consider in-field risk mitigation measures (if applied) in the context of regulatory surface water exposure calculations, as proposed by the SETAC MAgPIE workshop. Conclusion Based on these data, a robust case can be made to consider innovative runoff mitigation for risk assessment purposes by, e.g. lowering the CN in the exposure scenarios. In the assessment presented herein, an average decrease in the mean of the derived CN of 86 of 21 points (± 11, 10th percentile: 12) for potatoes could be derived. For maize, the mean calculated CN of 73 was lowered on average by 3 points.",https://enveurope.springeropen.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12302-020-00362-1,

This study estimates the consumptive water use of cultivating 5 cash crops, i.e. cassava, maize, rice, sugarcane and sweet potato in Peninsular Malaysia. The consumptive water uses for cultivating these 5 crops was determined based on the CROPWAT 8.0 and Penman Monteith model. CROPWAT 8.0 model was used to compute the evapotranspiration and crop water requirement (effective rainfall and irrigation requirement) of the cash crops grown in Peninsular Malaysia from 2005-2013 (9 years). It was found that the green water uses for cultivating cassava, maize, paddy, sugarcane and sweet potato for Peninsular Malaysia is higher than the blue water use. In conclusion, water use for cultivating agricultural crops will accelerate the competition on the consumption of clean water with the other sectors.

It was observed that summer groundnut was fast replaced by summer maize despite higher water requirement in summer maize (6–7 irrigation) than groundnut (3–4 irrigation) as farmers were getting higher yield (60–70 q/ha) in summer maize than groundnut (Yield: 37–40 q/ ha).Summer groundnut was perceived more sustainable than summer maize as the underground water level was fast depleting in these area (declining at the rate of 2 ft. every year). Wheat crop was getting marginalized among small land holders. Major cropping systems followed by such farmers were fallow/dhaincha-potato-maize; maize-potatomaize and maize-early potato-wheat (very less area). Diversification with mixed cropping of minor vegetables likes coriander and kharif onion was also analyzed in these districts. Flower cultivation based crop diversification was documented in this study. It was found that flowers like rose, bela (jasmine) and mehndi (henna) were cultivated by the majority of farmers to address the industrial requirements in the district for making edible products of roses as well as perfumes.

It comprises a mixture of amylose and amylopectin. Furthermore, amylose is a linear chain of hundreds of glucose molecules. Starches are not allowed to be dissolved in water. They can be digested by breaking down alpha bonds (glycosidic bonds). Its cyclic degradation products, called cyclodextrins, are the best role models for amylose. They can be considered simple turns of the amylose propeller that has imploded into a circular path. Both humans and animals have amylases, which allow them to digest starches. The important sources of starch include potatoes, rice, wheat, and maize for human consumption. The production of starches is how plants store glucose. The blue colour of starch produced by an iodine solution or iodine reaction is used for its identification. Polysaccharides with a reduced degree of polymerization, known as dextrins, are produced in the starch’s partial acid hydrolysis. Complete hydrolysis leads to glucose.

Twelve cropping systems viz., rice-wheat (CS1), basmati rice-hayola (transplanted)-mung bean (CS2), basmati rice-radish-maize (CS3), maize-potato-maize (CS4), maize + turmeric-barley + linseed (CS5), maize + turmeric-wheat + linseed (CS6), maize + radish-wheat + linseed-mung bean (CS7), groundnut + pigeon pea (5:1)-wheat + sarson (9:1) (CS8), maize + black gram-pea (bed) + celery (furrows) (CS9),: maize + pigeon pea-chickpea (bed) + gobhi sarson (furrows) (CS10), maize (green cobs) + vegetable cowpea + dhaincha (Sesbania spp.)-chickpea + gobhi sarson (CS11) and sorghum + cowpea (fodder)-wheat + gobhi sarson (9:1) (CS12) were tested in a four-times-replicated randomized block design. CS11 had the maximum system productivity (28.57 Mg ha−1), production efficiency (78.27 Kg Day−1 ha−1), irrigation water use efficiency (2.38 kg m−3), system net returns (4413.3 US$ ha−1), and benefit to cost (B:C) ratio (2.83) over others. In comparison to the CS1 system, this cropping system required ~78% less irrigation water for a unit economic production. However, the cultivation of CS12 registered the highest energy use efficiency (49.06%), net energy returns (6.46 × 103 MJ ha⁻¹), and global warming potential (GWP) (Mg CO2 e ha−1) at spatial scale. Among all the intensified systems, CS11 had the lowest GHGI (0.29 kg CO2 e kg−1). Furthermore, cultivation of CS6 resulted in the maximum bacterial and actinomycetes population in the soil, while CS5 yielded the highest fungal count (23.8 × 103 cfu g−1 dry soil) in soil.

The potential of the S1 data to detect the irrigation events was carried out using the Irrigation Event Detection Model (IEDM) over semi-arid and temperate oceanic climates in five study sites in south Europe and the Middle East. The IEDM is a decision tree model initially developed to detect irrigation events using the change detection algorithm applied to the S1 time series data. For each study site and at each agricultural plot, all available S1 images during the period of irrigation were used to construct an S1 time series and apply the IEDM. Different types of major summer irrigated crops were analyzed in this study, including Maize, Soybean, Sorghum and Potato, mainly with the sprinkler irrigation technique. The irrigation detection accuracy was evaluated using S1 images and the IEDM against the climatic condition of the studied area, the vegetation development (by means of the normalized difference vegetation index, NDVI) and the revisit time of the S1 sensor. The main results showed generally good overall accuracy for irrigation detection using the S1 data, reaching 67% for all studied sites together. This accuracy varied according to the climatic conditions of the studied area, with the highest accuracy for semi-arid areas and lowest for temperate areas. The analysis of the irrigation detection as a function of the crop type showed that the accuracy of irrigation detection decreases as the vegetation becomes well developed. The main findings demonstrated that the density of the available S1 images in the S1 time series over a given area affects the irrigation detection accuracy, especially for temperate areas. In temperate areas the irrigation detection accuracy decreased from 70% when 15 to 20 S1 images were available per month to reach less than 56% when less than 10 S1 images per month were available over the study sites.",https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4395/12/11/2725/pdf?version=1667897163,

Whereas, a randomized complete block design was used for the organoleptic characteristics data. Accordingly, the addition of orange‐fleshed sweet potato, sweet lupine, and moringa leaf powder to maize‐based porridge showed a significant (p < .05) increase in bulk density (0.70 ± 0.02 to 0.74 ± 0.03), water solubility index (10.09 ± 0.08 to 14.16 ± 0.23), protein (9.00 ± 0.00 to 21.10 ± 0.02), ash (1.43 ± 0.07 to 3.36 ± 0.08), fiber (1.55 ± 0.05 to 3.21 ± 0.01), fat (3.37 ± 0.02 to 5.37 ± 0.07), energy (370.89 ± 0.70 to 400.53 ± 0.65), vitamin A (0.00 to 41.00 ± 1.55), iron (3.49 ± 0.02 to 9.58 ± 0.29), zinc (2.89 ± 0.01 to 3.62 ± 0.06), and calcium (40.49 ± 0.42 to 113.34 ± 0.52) contents. However, water absorption index (4.76 ± 0.01 to 3.84 ± 0.01), moisture (8.50 ± 0.08 to 5.60 ± 0.04), and carbohydrate (76.11 ± 0.22 to 66.94 ± 0.02) content were decreased as a result of blending proportion compared to maize porridge (control). Formulated instant maize‐based porridge prepared from 50% maize, 35% orange‐fleshed sweet potato, 10% sweet lupine, and 5% moringa leaf powder scored the highest (above 4 out of 5 in a 5‐point hedonic scale) in all sensory attributes. In conclusion, the addition of orange‐fleshed sweet potato, sweet lupine flour, and moringa leaf powder has improved both macro‐ and micronutrients. Therefore, the development of nutritious maize‐based instant porridge formulated from readily available and underutilized crops can be achieved by extrusion cooking that helps to reduce the prevalence of malnutrition and food insecurity.",https://doi.org/10.1002/fsn3.4483,

This study establishes a rapid inversion model for deep soil moisture (0–200 cm) in dryland agriculture using data from drone-based multispectral remote sensing. Maize, millet, sorghum, and potatoes were selected for this study, with multispectral data, canopy leaf, and soil moisture content at various depths collected every 3 to 6 days. Vegetation indices highly correlated with crop canopy leaf moisture content (p < 0.01) and were identified using Pearson correlation analysis, leading to the development of linear and nonlinear regression models for predicting moisture content in canopy leaves and soil. The results show a significant linear correlation between the predicted and actual canopy leaf moisture levels for the four crops, according to the chosen vegetation indices. The use of canopy leaf moisture content to predict surface soil moisture (0–20 cm) demonstrated enhanced accuracy. The models designed for the top 20 cm of soil moisture successfully estimated deep soil moisture levels (up to 200 cm) for all four crops. The 20 cm range soil moisture model showed improvements over the 10 cm range model, with increases in Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Coefficient of Determination (R2), and Nash–Sutcliffe Efficiency Coefficient (NSE) by 0.4, 0.8, 0.73, and 0.34, respectively, in the corn area; 0.28, 0.69, 0.48, and 0.25 in the millet area; 0.4, 0.48, 0.22, and 0.52 in the sorghum area; and 1.14, 0.81, 0.73, and 0.56 in the potato area, all with an average Relative Error (RE) of less than 10% across the crops.

On a multi-crop commercial farm, different factors affect cropland allocation, among which crop evapotranspiration is one of the most important factors regarding the seasonally or annually available water resources for irrigation in combination with the in-season effective precipitation. The objective of the present study was to estimate crop evapotranspiration for four major crops grown on the Navajo Agricultural Products Industry (NAPI) farm for the 2016–2010 period to help crop management in crop plant allocation based on the different objectives of the NAPI. The monthly and seasonal satellite-based ETa of maize, potatoes, dry beans, and alfalfa were retrieved and compared using the analysis of variance and the least significant difference (LSD) at 5% of significance. Our results showed the highly significant effects of year, months, and crops. The year 2020 obtained the highest crop ETa, and July had the most evapotranspiration demand, followed by August, June, September, and May, and the pool of April, March, February, January, December, and November registered the lowest crop ETa. Maize monthly ETa varied from 17.5 to 201.7 mm with an average seasonal ETa of 703.8 mm. The monthly ETa of potatoes varied from 9.8 to 207.5 mm, and their seasonal ETa averaged 600.9 mm. The dry bean monthly ETa varied from 10.4 to 178.4 mm, and the seasonal ETa averaged 506.2 mm. The alfalfa annual ETa was the highest at 1015.4 mm, as it is a perennial crop. The alfalfa monthly ETa varied from 8.2 to 202.1 mm. The highest monthly crop ETa was obtained in July for all four crops.

Export-orientated soy production in regions of South America is associated with large-scale ecosystem destruction. Since soy is an important source of animal fodder, policymakers are developing schemes to support and enhance sustainable domestic soy cultivation, especially in the EU. Expanded soy cultivation should ideally provide high yields and at the same time promote environmental benefits. For this purpose, we applied a multi-objective optimization algorithm that selects areas with maximum soy suitability, minimum erosion risk, need for low fertilizer input due to water quality issues, and need for diversification of monotonous crop rotations. We use the state of Bavaria in Germany as a case study, modeling full self-sufficiency of soy. The results of the optimization indicate synergies between plantation suitability with need for low fertilization input and crop variation, which implies that the environmental benefit of nitrogen fixation and rotation diversification from soy plants can easily be reconciled with food productivity. However, slight trade-offs occur between erosion risk and the three other objectives, i.e., locations with better soy production might be more prone toward erosion risk. As a potential consequence of expanded soy cultivation in Bavaria, we identified winter wheat, grain maize, potatoes, and sugar beet as those crops that have the highest share of displaced cultivation area. To reduce such land use conflicts and ensure self-sufficiency in relevant crops, we recommend to limit the use of soy as animal feed. Nevertheless, we propose to explicitly incorporate the local need for the environmental benefits of soy cultivation in the planning for soy expansion. In doing so, domestic soy can turn into a real sustainable alternative to imported plant protein.",https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fsufs.2022.916003/pdf,

Over the years, different starch-based packaging films have been developed, but the impact of botanical sources on film performance has rarely been exploited. Efforts devoted to exploiting the role played by the clusteroluminescence of starch in food packaging are also lacking. This study fills these gaps by comparing the properties of edible starch films generated from different botanical sources (including water chestnuts, maize and potatoes) in food packaging. Such films are produced by solution casting. They are highly homogeneous, with a thickness of 55–65 μm. Variations in the botanical sources of starch have no significant impact on the color parameters (including L*, a* and b*) and morphological features of the films but affect the water vapor permeability, maximum tensile strength and elongation at break. Starch films from water chestnut show the highest percentage of transmittance, whereas those from potatoes are the opaquest. No observable change in the intensity of clusteroluminescence occurs when a packaging bag generated from starch is used to package fresh or frozen chicken breast meat; however, a remarkable decline in the intensity of luminescence is noted when the frozen meat is thawed inside the bag. Our results reveal the impact of starch sources on the performance of starch films in food packaging and demonstrate the possibility of using the clusteroluminescence of starch as an indicator to reveal the state of packaged frozen food.",https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0375/12/4/437/pdf?version=1650267944,

To investigate the effect of cover crops on soil physical properties, weed control and yield of white radish, a filed experiment was carried out using randomized complete block design with three replications in 2017 and 2018 in the research field of Mohaghegh Ardabili University, Ardabil, Iran. Experimental treatments included: cultivation of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) and hairy vetch (Vicia villosa L.) cover crops as monoculture and dual mixed crop 50:50 ratio and without cover crops (control). The results showed that the highest biomass (5172 kg.ha) of cover crops over two years from mixed barley + vetch and the lowest (3396 kg.ha) obtained from monoculture of hairy vetch. The barley monoculture reduced dry weight of common lambsquarters (59.1%), wild mustard (54.7%), Anchusa italica (73.1%) and reduced the total weeds (64.9%) as compared to the control. The soil bulk density, soil porosity percentage and time required for water infiltration were 1.32 g.cm, 50.21%, 7.21 second, respectively, and improved by monoculture of hairy vetch. The highest white radish yield (46100 kg.ha) obtained from monoculture of barley cover crop treatment which increased by 25.97% as compared to control. Based on the results of this experiment, monoculture of barley as cover crop could effectively control weeds and increase white radish yield. However, monoculture of hairy vetch was more effective in improving soil physical properties as compared to other treatments.",https://doi.org/10.52547/abj.22.4.321,

Potato, sweet potato, and cassava are also made into flours for food manufacture. Root and tuber starches such as these exhibit high viscosity [1]. Potato starch has the highest swelling power and the highest viscosity among all commercial starches [2]. Cassava starch reportedly has a unique, very high single-stage swelling proper ty and peak viscosity [3]. Starches obtained from such crops have different particle sizes, and mixing one starch with another changes the pasting properties [4,5]. The particle size of rice flour affects the pasting properties, starch damage [6], and flowability [7]. Mechanically damaged starch during milling [8] is of considerable importance to the baking industry since damaged starch both absorbs more water and is more susceptible to enzyme degradation than intact starch at dough-forming temperatures [9]. However, no study has reported the effects of pulverization of different starches on their physiochemical properties. A better understanding would extend the use of various flours. The main objective of this study was to find out the effects of particle size reduction and starch damage by pulverization among different flours on pasting properties. 2.

A located experiment was conducted in 2015 and 2016 for two con-secutive years, and six ridge-and-furrow rainwater harvesting with mulching patterns were set up in dry farmland of southern Ningxia. Ridges were mulched with plastic film, while furrows were covered with plastic film (PP), maize straw (PS), biodegradable film (PB), bast fiber film (PF), liquid film (PL), and furrow without mulching (PN), and the flat planting without mulching was used as control check (CK). We investigated the effect of ridge-and-furrow rainwater harvesting with mulching on soil water, temperature, nutrients, and potato yield. Furrow-and-ridge rainwater harvesting with mulching patterns could significantly increase averag e soil water storage in 0–200 cm layer during the whole growth period, and PS treatment had the best effect on soil water conservation. Compared with CK, PP treatment significantly increased topsoil temperature (0–25 cm) during the growth period, while PS treatment significantly reduced topsoil temperature in potato. Compared with the treatment before the experiment, the contents of soil organic carbon, total nitrogen, alkali-hydrolysed nitrogen, and available phosphorus in 0–40 cm layer under different furrow-and-ridge rainwater harvesting with mulching patterns were significantly increased, while the soil available potassium contents were significantly decreased during the two-year experiments. Compared with the control, the soil nutrients with different furrow-and-ridge rainwater harvesting with mulching patterns were significantly increased with the largest increase in soil nutrients in PS treatment. Ridge-and-furrow rainwater harvesting with mulching patterns could significantly improve potato yield and marketable tuber rate, and PS and PP treatments were the highest, followed by PB, PF, and PL treatments, while there was no significant difference between PN and CK treatments.

As the demand for clean water increases, so does the need to implement more efficient strategies for water management in irrigated agriculture. While the benefits of precision irrigation in high-value crops, such as cannabis, tomatoes, and potatoes, are fully recognized, there is still need to investigate and implement cheap and efficient irrigation strategies for widespread low-value crops such as maize. In this study, the soil moisture dynamics in a sprinkler-irrigated maize field in Veneto (Northeastern Italy) was monitored using six time domain reflectometry (TDR) probes for the entire growing season. The TDR sensors were positioned at different depths into two separate sites: an Uninformed Site irrigated based on the farmer's experience and an Informed Site in which a water balance irrigation strategy was applied based on soil moisture measurements. A parsimonious hydrological model was then implemented and calibrated to quantify the different water balance terms (precipitation, evapotranspiration, lateral fluxes, and deep percolation). The comparison between the water budget terms in the two sites highlights that soil moisture monitoring during agriculture activities leads to substantial savings in terms of irrigation water volumes requirements and cost, without compromising the productivity of the crop field. A simplified upscaling of the results at the regional scale, assuming average conditions as in this study site and growing season, reveals that potentially significant economic savings, compared to the total profits linked to maize crops, could be possible.",https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frwa.2021.627551/pdf,

For nearly a century, agriculture has come to rely on synthetic nitrogen fertilizers produced from ammonia. This large-scale production is now supporting nearly half of the world’s population through increased food production. But whilst the use of synthetic nitrogen fertilizers brought enormous benefits, including those of the Green Revolution, the world needs to disengage from our ever-increasing reliance on nitrogen fertilizers produced from fossil fuels. Their pollution of the atmosphere and water systems has become a major global environmental and economic concern. Naturally, legume crops such as peas and beans can fix nitrogen symbiotically by interacting with soil nitrogen-fixing rhizobia, bacteria that become established intracellularly within root nodules. Ever since this was first demonstrated in 1888, consistent attempts have been made to extend the symbiotic interaction of legumes with nitrogen-fixing bacteria to non-legume crops, particularly cereals. In 1988, a fresh impetus arose from the discovery of Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus (Gd), a non-nodulating, non-rhizobial, nitrogen-fixing bacterium isolated from the intercellular juice of sugarcane. Subsequently, strains of Gd inoculated under specific conditions were shown to intracellularly colonize the roots and shoots of the cereals: wheat, maize (corn) and rice, as well as crops as diverse as potato, tea, oilseed rape, grass and tomato. An extensive field trials programme using a seed inoculum technology based on Gd (NFix®) indicates that NFix® is able to significantly improve yields of wheat, maize, oilseed rape and grasses, in both the presence and absence of synthetic nitrogen fertilizers. Evidence suggests that these benefits are accruing through a possible combination of intracellular symbiotic nitrogen fixation, enhanced rates of photosynthesis and the presence of additional plant growth factors. Here, we discuss the research events that have led to this important development and present results demonstrating the efficacy of NFix® technology in non-legume crops, in particular cereals.",https://doi.org/10.1186/s40066-016-0084-2,

Thus, the objective of irrigation is to maintain the adequate moisture content in the root zone, such that the crop yield is not adversely affected (Kumar et al. 2012; Kumar et al. 2020). However, in the current scenario of climate change, rapid industrialization and population increase, there is tremendous pressure on water resources both quantitatively and qualitatively (Rao and Poonia 2011). Hence, precise allocation of water resources considering the crop water requirement and proper knowledge of soil composition is essential to attain optimum yield, and maximum water use efficiency (Mehta and Pandey 2016). The crop water requirement is generally crop evapotranspiration (ETc) considering atmospheric water loss through plant transpiration and soil evaporation simultaneously (Kumar 2017; Poddar et al. 2021). There are several methods for direct estimation of ETc which includes energy balance, microclimatological methods, field water balance and Lysimeters. However, the indirect methods includes measurement of reference evapotranspiration and crop coefficients (Chaudhari et al. 1999). Estimating water balance in the Lysimeter is the most reliable and useful approach for determining actual ETc under field conditions (Kashyap and Panda, 2001). Hence, the present study was undertaken for rabi (Wheat, Indian mustard, Potato) and kharif (Maize, Sorghum, Guar) crops grown in a humid subtropical agro-climate of western Himalayas with a specific objective to estimate the ETc using the lysimeter water balance approach.

Besides the use of surface water for irrigation, it is essential to unlock the groundwater potential. It is equally important to use soil management and water-saving systems to overcome the declining soil fertility and the temporal water scarcity in the region. In this study, the solar MajiPump was introduced to enable dry season crop production in Ethiopia using shallow groundwater sources. The capacity of the MajiPumps (MP400 and MP200) was tested for the discharge head and discharge using three types of solar panels (150 W and 200 W rigid, and 200 W flexible). Besides, drip irrigation and conservation agriculture (CA) farming systems were evaluated in terms of water productivity and crop yield in comparison to the farmers’ practice (overhead irrigation and tilled farming system). Results indicated that the maximum discharge head capacity of the MajiPumps was 18 m, 14 m, 10 m when using MP400 with 200 W rigid, MP400 with 200 W flexible, and MP200 with 150 W rigid solar panels, respectively. The corresponding MajiPump flow rates ranged from 7.8 L/min to 24.6 L/min, 3 L/min to 25 L/min, and 3.6 L/min to 22.2 L/min, respectively. Compared to farmer’s practice, water productivity was significantly improved under the CA farming and the drip irrigation systems for both irrigated vegetables (garlic, onion, cabbage, potato) and rainfed maize production. The water productivity of garlic, cabbage, potato, and maize was increased by 256%, 43%, 53%, and 9%, respectively, under CA as compared to conventional tillage (CT) even under overhead irrigation. Thus, farmers can obtain a significant water-saving benefit from CA regardless of water application systems. However, water and crop productivity could be further improved in the combined use of MajiPump with CA and drip irrigation (i.e., 38% and 33% water productivity and 43% and 36% crop productivity improvements were observed for potato and onion, respectively). Similarly, compared to CT, the use of CA significantly increased garlic, cabbage, potato, and maize yield by 170%, 42%, 43%, and 15%, respectively under the MajiPump water-lifting system. Overall, the solar-powered drip irrigation and CA farming system were found to be efficient to expand small-scale irrigation and improve productivity and livelihoods of smallholder farmers in Ethiopia.",https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4395/11/1/17/pdf?version=1609933251,

An adequate amount of plant material is treated with a hot CaCl 2 solution for 1/2 hour and the solute is diluted to 25 ml with CaCl 2 . This basic solution serves to measure absorbancy, as well as for starch determination. The first measurement is done by the dilution of a proper amount of basic solution with water and after adding a diluted iodine-iodide solution the reading of B.V. is taken off. The second measurement is done by the precipitation of a starch iodine complex from a proper amount of the basic solution, which is then purified, destroyed by Na 2 SO 3 solution, and starch is determined by the anthrone method. These two readings serve for the establishing of B.V. for the starch. Once established, B.V. can be used for starch determination in the proper plant material. A high degree of variation of the B.V. was found. The highest B.V. was obtained for wrinkled pea seeds (17.4); walnut, potato, smooth pea and pear gave values from 12.6 to 11.0, common bean and broad bean - 10.3 and 9.7, Triticale , carrot, rye, wheat and garden parsley from 8.7 to 8.0 and maize, oat, normal rice from 7.6 to 6.2.

There is a strong need for improvement in the fair yield of potato through managed production techniques and best soil nutrient combinations. To find out the best combination of fertilizer level of NPK on growth, yield and quality of the potato crop, nine field experiments on potato crop were conducted at Rawalpindi division, Punjab Pakistan for three successive Rabi seasons during 2014-2017.

Each region’s agricultural lands in Indonesia have distinct features (e.g., water capacity, land porosity, land height, etc.). Rice, maize, red beans and green beans are significant food crops that are commonly cultivated in Indonesia. The goal of this research is to develop an extended Fuzzy logic-based Decision Support Model (FDSM). The model is able to propose the best food crops to plant on a certain plot of land or location. These suggestions are based on the worth of the distance between the plants as well as the unique worth of the land or location. These suggestions are based on the worth of the distance between the plants as well as the unique worth of the land or location. The primary methods employed in this study are fuzzy logic and Euclidean distance measuring. The fuzzy logic method is used on purpose to prevent confusing values and to consider parameter values based on human linguistics. The fitness value is then calculated using the Euclidean distance value as a basic value for choice suggestions. In this follow-up study, three parameters from previous research were included, for a total of eleven factors (water availability, temperature, humidity, land height, land slope, rainfall, land porosity, rocks on the surface, flood potential and water acidity level). biological food plants in search of the best value based on eight different types of food crops, the model generates simulation suggestions for 514 administrative areas in 34 districts or cities in Indonesia (rice, maize, peanuts, soybeans, green beans, sweet potatoes, cassava and wheat).",https://doi.org/10.3844/jcssp.2021.709.723,

The objective of this study was to assess farmers’ perception, production constraints, preferences, and breeding priorities of sweetpotato in selected agro-ecologies of Rwanda. A total of 495 farmers were surveyed in 2013 in eight representative districts: Bugesera and Kayonza in the Eastern Province, Gakenke and Rulindo in the Northern Province, and Gisagara, Huye, and Muhanga in the Southern Province. Data were collected through a participatory rural appraisal (PRA) methodology using a semistructured questionnaire and focus group discussions. Pairwise comparison of 16 food crops allocated sweetpotato as one of the five important food crops for food security and income generation. Drought stress, unavailability of improved cultivars and planting material, and pest and disease damage were perceived to be the five main constraints limiting sweetpotato production, contributing to 17.3%, 15.0%, 12.9%, 11.7%, and 11.5%, respectively. The most important sweetpotato cultivar traits had high yield, early maturity, drought tolerance, disease and pest tolerance, and good culinary taste at 22.5%, 18.5%, 15.4%, 12.7%, and 10.1%, respectively. The characteristics of good storage roots identified by farmers included high dry matter content, good culinary taste, good shape, root size, and sweetness representing 27.4%, 18.8%, 16.1%, 11.6%, and 9.4%, respectively. Each agro-ecological zone has its own specific sweetpotato production constraints and farmers’ preferences, necessitating targeted breeding of different sweetpotato cultivars for each agro-ecological zone for enhanced productivity and successful adoption of cultivars. Globally the demand for quantity and quality food is fast increasing as a result of population growth, limited water and land, and overexploitation of available resources (Godfray et al., 2010; Tilman et al., 2001). Moreover, global climate change aggravates the biotic and abiotic stresses on food crops (Tester and Langridge, 2010). These environmental changes will negatively affect crop production and food security. Therefore, novel mitigation strategies are required to boost crop productivity and ensure food security. Improved and resilient crop cultivars and their production technologies are among these strategies (Brown and Funk, 2008). Participatory plant breeding is usually conducted to ensure adoption of newly developed crop cultivars and their production packages by smallholder farmers of marginal agro-ecological and socioeconomic groups (Ceccarelli et al., 2007). In the past, plant breeding focused on developing high-yielding and improved crop cultivars in favorable environments and under controlled experimental situations (Bänziger and Cooper, 2001). As such, conventional plant breeding did not consider farmers’ preferences and attributes, locally available germplasm, and the real conditions of small-scale farmers in pursuit of developing crop cultivars for broad adaptation (Ceccarelli et al., 2000; Witcombe et al., 1996). These failures to engage with the realities faced by local farmers have been identified as the primary causes for the consistently low adoption of newly developed ‘‘improved’’ crop cultivars and their production packages released by government and NGO scientists (Adesina and Baidu-Forson, 1995). There are varied preferences and needs by end users for crop cultivars. For instance, for industrial starch production, sweetpotato cultivars are required to have high dry matter content, whereas cultivars for human consumption should have other traits such as attractive skin and flesh color, good cooking quality, and high b-carotene, among others. Sweetpotato cultivars intended for animal feed should have high protein content (Lebot, 2009). Therefore, sweetpotato breeding should involve the needs of stakeholders in the developing of new cultivars and new agricultural technologies to meet their diverse requirements (Atlin et al., 2001; Rees et al., 2003). Agricultural technologies developed through participatory research have a greater chance of adoption and diffusion by farmers because they are developed in response to local constraints and meet end users’ needs and preferences (Ashby and Lilja, 2004). Various research approaches have been reported in participatory breeding of new crop cultivars, including consultative approaches, collaborative approaches, collegial approaches, and farmer experimentation (Ashby and Lilja, 2004). Advantages of farmer participatory research include: 1) codefinition of breeding objectives; 2) participatory evaluation of germplasm; 3) identification of breeding priorities; and 4) participatory selection of promising progenies (Ceccarelli and Grando, 2009). In one case, the incorporation of participatory approaches into conventional breeding programs reduced the time taken for cultivar development from 9 to 6 years (Lilja and Aw-Hasaan, 2003). In sweetpotato breeding, farmers’ knowledge and experience during preliminary on-farm and on-station evaluations may enable quick identification of promising genotypes (Abidin et al., 2005). Song (1998) reported that the end users’ participation in the improvement of seed systems led to the efficient use of national genetic resources and promoted their production. In selection of high-yielding genotypes, Ceccarelli et al. (2009) observed that farmers have the same selection ability as breeders. Therefore, close collaboration between farmers and breeders is necessary to speed up the breeding process and to respond to appropriate needs of stakeholders. Application of participatory research requires integrated skills (Ceccarelli et al., 2009). A careful choice of research goals, target environments, and selection of partners are critical steps of participatory research. It also demands a systematic understanding of different types of participatory research approaches to select the most appropriate tools (Ashby and Lilja, 2004) such as participatory rural appraisal, focus group discussions, participatory selection in segregating populations, and participatory cultivar testing and selection (Sperling et al., 2001). Sweetpotato is an important food and feed crop in sub-Sahara Africa and ranks fourth after maize, bananas, and cassava (FAOSTAT, 2013). It yields considerably well in poor soils and tolerates extreme weather conditions unsuitable to other food crops such as maize and banana (Woolfe, 1992).

Rwanda is the third in sweetpotato production in East Africa and the first in per-capita consumption of sweetpotato in Africa (Chassy et al., 2008). More than 95% of Rwandan farmers grow sweetpotato for household food security (Njeru et al., 2008). During the farming seasons many rural families rely on sweetpotato because of a shortage of other food security crops such as cassava, potato, banana, and maize (Gibson et al., 2004; Njeru et al., 2008). As a result of its high productivity per unit area and continuous availability, sweetpotato is an ideal food crop for Rwanda, the most densely populated (416 persons/km) country in Africa, with limited agricultural land (NISR, 2012). The crop requires less production inputs such as fertilizers and pesticides than other major crops (Woolfe, 1992). However, the average sweetpotato yield in Rwanda is low, 5.9 t·ha wet weight compared with yields of 22.8 and 21.7 t·ha reported in the United States and Japan, respectively (FAOSTAT, 2013). This requires targeted participatory sweetpotato breeding to develop improved and highyielding cultivars, and their production packages, according to the needs of the growers in the country. Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess farmers’ perception, production and productivity constraints, preferences, and breeding priorities of sweetpotato in selected agro-ecologies of Rwanda. Results of the study may assist in the breeding and sustainable production of sweetpotato in Rwanda and countries with similar agro-ecologies. Materials and Methods Description of the study areas. The study was carried out in 2013 in Bugesera and Kayonza districts of Eastern Province, Gakenke and Rulindo districts of Northern Province, and Gisagara, Huye, and Muhanga districts of the Southern Province of Rwanda (Fig. 1). These districts were selected because of the importance of sweetpotato production in their food production (Ndamage et al., 1992). Agriculture is the main economic activity of the selected districts, employing more than 90% of the population. In these districts farmers grow many food crops including beans, sorghum, sweetpotato, bananas, and maize (NISR, 2010). The Rwanda Agricultural Board (RAB) has promoted cultivation of sweetpotato in these areas to produce raw material for the Urwibutso Enterprise, which was established for the industrial production of sweetpotato biscuits, cakes, bread, and juice (Rwakabuba, 2012). In Gisagara, Huye, and Muhanga districts, a range of food crops is grown, including sweetpotato, which is the main food crop supplied to provincial cities (Kayitare, 2006). Sampling method. A multistage sampling was used for the study. Two sectors in each district were sampled.

Because of these changes, Aspergillus parasiticus was isolated, for the first time, from maize grain in Serbia (Nikolic et al, 2018). The presence of black powdery mycelia on maize ears indicated occurrence of species of the genus Aspergillus section Nigri, which led to the need for detailed identification of these fungi. Disease incidence ranged from 10 and 15% in August 2013. Maize ears with black powdery symptoms were collected from field in Zemun Polje, Serbia. Symptomatic kernels were surface sterilized with 1% sodium hypochlorite solution for 3 min, rinsed three times with sterilized water, then incubated at 25°C in the dark for 7 days on potato dextrose agar (PDA). Twenty isolates were identified as genus Aspergillus section Nigri. Monospore cultures formed black cottony colonies with a yellowish border on PDA. The average colony diameter was 50 mm. In order to reliably identify, isolates were transferred to Malt Extract agar (MEA) and Czapek Yeast Autolysate agar (CYA) (Samson et al, 2014). On CYA fungal colonies consisted of a white mycelium, covered by a layer of black conidiophores. On MEA fungal colonies were dense, black, with yellowish border. The reverse side was colorless to pale yellow, with a yellow ring in the middle. The average size of conidia was 4.3 µm. The conidia were globose to sub-globose, smooth to roughened, which coincides with previous research (Silva et al, 2020). Given that the fungi Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus welwitschiae are morphologically indistinguishable (Susca et al, 2016), species level identification was completed by analysis of a partial sequence of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region (ITS1/ITS4 primers) and calmodulin gene (CMD5/CMD6 primers) (Samson et al., 2014). The sequences were compared with the sequences of A. welwitschiae strains registered in the GenBank database based on nucleotide similarity, and results showed 99,64 and 100% similarity with ITS (OL711714) and calmodulin (KX894585), respectively. The sequence was deposited in GenBank with accession numbers OQ456471 (ITS) and OQ426518 (calmodulin). We also confirmed the presence of this species with specific primers (AWEL1/AWEL2) designed by Susca et al. 2020. Pathogenicity test was performed in Zemun Polje on the same maize hybrid from which the fungal species was isolated. Using artificial inoculations by the injecting conidial suspension into the silk channel, three days after 50% of plants reached the silking stage. Twenty ears were inoculated with each isolate, in four replicates (Reid et al, 1996). Inoculum was prepared from 7-day-old colonies on PDA, and 2 ml of a conidial suspension (1×106 spores/ml) was used. Control plants were inoculated with sterile water. All inoculated ears showed symptoms, similar to those from field infections. Control ears were symptomless. The fungus was reisolated and was morphologically identical to the original isolates, thus completing Koch's postulates. Based on molecular, morphological and pathogenic properties, the isolates were identified as A. welwitschiae. This is the first report of A. welwitschiae as the causal agent of black maize ear rot not only in Serbia, but also in the other countries of the Western Balkans. Given that the fungus A. welwitschiae synthesizes both ochratoxin A (OTA) (Battilani et al, 2006) and fumonisin (FB) (Frisvad et al, 2011), further studies should be focused on assessment its aggressiveness and toxicological profile.",http://rik.mrizp.rs/bitstream/123456789/1315/1/bitstream_6985.pdf,

Anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum graminicola can infect all maize tissues, although stalk rot and seedling blight cause more significant economic damage (Munkvold and White, 2016). Anthracnose stalk rot is characterized by a distinctive external blackening of the lower stalks resulting in large black streaks, while the pith turns dark brown and has a shredded appearance. Like most stalk rots, the most obvious symptom is a sudden death of plants before grain maturity, and plant lodging. Symptoms commonly appear late in the season, suspicious maize stems of cultivar Tuy exhibiting symptoms of anthracnose stalk rot were collected from a field in Pontevedra, Galicia, Spain (Geographical coordinates: 42°23'27.1"" N - 8°30'46.3"" W) between June and December of 2022. Stem samples, approximately 50 mm2, were dissected and surface-disinfected for 90 seconds in 20% sodium hypochlorite (v/v) and rinsed three times in sterile distilled water. The samples were transferred to one half-strength acidified potato dextrose agar (PDA) supplemented with ampicillin (100 µg/mL) and lactic acid 90% (1.5 mL/L) and incubated for 5 days at 25 ºC (Sukno et al. 2008). Single spores were transferred to fresh PDA plates to obtain pure culture isolates. A total of six isolates were obtained, and among them, two were selected for further characterization (SP-36820-1 and SP-36820-3). Colonies grown on PDA have dark gray aerial mycelium with orange-colored spore masses. Conidia are falcate, slightly curved, tapered toward the tips, and are produced in acervuli with setae, measuring 37.65 to 24.84 x 8.02 to 4.67 µm, respectively (n = 100). These morphological characteristics are in agreement with C. graminicola previously described by Bergstrom and Nicholson (1999). Isolates were grown in potato dextrose broth (PDB) for 3 days at 25 ºC and total genomic DNA was extracted using a DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA, USA). The internal transcribed spacer region of rDNA and the manganese-type superoxide dismutase gene (SOD2) were amplified using primers ITS4/ITS5 (White et al. 1990) and SOD625/SOD507 (Fang et al. 2002) and consequently sequenced. GenBank BLAST analysis revealed that the sequences were 100% identical to strains of C. graminicola. All sequences were deposited in GenBank (see e-Xtra 1 for accession numbers). To confirm Koch's postulates, plants of a derivative of maize inbred line Mo940 (developmental stage V3) were placed horizontally in a tray for inoculation and 20 droplets (7.5 µL) of a suspension of 3 x 105 conidia per milliliter were placed on the surface of the third leaf. The trays were closed to retain moisture and incubated overnight at 23ºC. The next day, the plants were returned to a vertical position and incubated in a growth chamber at 25ºC with 80% humidity and a light cycle of 16 h of light and 8 h of dark (Vargas et al. 2012). After four days inoculated leaves presented brown elongated lesions with necrotic centers consistent with C. graminicola infection, whereas control plants remained asymptomatic. The strains reisolated from infected leaves were morphologically identical to the original isolates. To our knowledge, this is the first report of Colletotrichum graminicola causing maize anthracnose in Spain. Recently, maize anthracnose was also reported in Bosnia and Herzegovina and China (Duan et al. 2019; Cuevas-Fernández et al. 2019), suggesting the pathogen's geographic range is increasing, which may be a threat to maize cultivation in locations with optimal humid conditions for disease development.",https://digital.csic.es/bitstream/10261/338669/1/pdis-04-23-0729-pdn.pdf,

This study investigates the extent of elephant crop damage on 66 farms in the Selous–Niassa corridor (Tanzania), to search for potential management solutions to this problem. We found that the relative abundance of highly preferred crops (area covered by preferred crops divided by the total area of each farm) was by far the most important factor determining crop damage by elephants. Eighteen crop types were ranked according to their preference by elephants. Sweet potatoes, bananas, peanuts, onions, pumpkins and maize were the most preferred crops, with maize the most common crop among those highly preferred. On average elephants damaged 25.7% of the cultivated farmland they entered. A beta regression model suggests that a reduction in the cultivation of preferred crops from 75 to 25% of the farmland area decreases elephant crop damage by 64%. Water availability (distance to the nearest waterhole) and the presence of private investors (mostly hunting tourism companies) were of lower importance in determining elephant crop damage. Thus, damage by elephants increased with shorter distances to waterholes and decreased in areas with private investors. However, further studies are required, particularly of the perceived costs and benefits of elephants to local communities. Farm aggregation and the use of non-preferred crops that also require less water would potentially reduce elephant damage but would be a major lifestyle change for some local communities.",https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/8A69CAA53E90DABAC7B08BFF2227E2C2/S0030605319000978a.pdf/div-class-title-food-preferences-determine-human-elephant-coexistence-in-african-woodlands-div.pdf,

Undernutrition is the more common form of malnutrition in developing countries, and results from insufficient intake of protein and/or energy, and may sometimes result from poor breastfeeding and/or complementary feeding practices. WHO recommends exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of the baby’s life, followed by gradual introduction of complementary foods, with continuous breastfeeding till baby is at least two years. Most babies are not exclusively breastfed for six months, and even more not breastfed till 24 months. Most complementary foods in developing countries are homemade, with plant-based ingredients, using improper processing techniques, making them low in nutrient content. Aims: This work aimed at formulating Complementary foods from ten different proportions of local staples; yellow maize, rice, potatoes, egg whites, soybeans, pawpaw, watermelon, pineapple and oranges, using standard processing techniques. Methodology: The blends (A to J) were formulated and were evaluated for colour, taste, flavor and consistency using nine scaled hedonic point, and the preferred five were evaluated for proximate composition, some vitamins and minerals, functional properties, and for microbes using standard Association of Analytical Chemists (AOAC) methods. The results were statistically analysed using Microsoft excel, SPSS and Graphpad Instat softwares. Results: Results from sensory analysis showed that the preferred formulas were B, H, A, C, G, respectively.

Birbir River is one of well-known river found in western Ethiopia. The Birbir River is a tributary of the Baro-Akobo river basin, which creates Baro River when it joins with Gebba River. Ethiopia has immense potential in expanding irrigation using available water resources. But due to lack of information related to cultivable and irrigation suitability of the land, its agricultural system does not yet fully productive. Geographic Information System can be an effective tool in identifying irrigable land and mapping of suitable land for irrigation. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to assess the surface irrigation potential of the Birbir river watershed using ArcGIS 10.3. Different methods of data processing and analysis have been employed in this study. The main suitability factors used to identify the potential irrigable land for surface irrigation were slope, soil texture, soil depth, soil type, soil drainage characteristics, land use, land cover and distance to water source. The consistency of rainfall and stream flow data were checked by double mass curve and the areal mean of rainfall and temperature data were determined by using Theissen polygon method whereas the irrigation water demands of the selected two crops (maize and potato) were calculated separately using FAO cropwat model. By weighting values of the seven factors using Analytic Hierarchy Process and overlaying by weighted overlay in ArcGIS 10.3, the irrigation suitability map was developed and potential irrigable land for surface irrigation was found to be 17%, 63% and 20% for highly suitable (S1), moderately suitable (S2), and marginally suitable (S3) respectively. Irrigation potential of the Birbir river watershed was obtained by comparing monthly gross irrigation requirements of the identified land suitable for surface irrigation and the available 80% mean monthly dependable flows in the river catchments. The potential irrigable land that can be irrigated without provision of storage structures was found to be around 68,000 ha from the total of 106,223 ha suitable land for surface irrigation.",https://doi.org/10.11648/j.ajce.20210904.14,

This study explores the effect of three management practices on the soil water balance and plant growth, specifically on evapotranspiration (ET) and yield (Y) and thus the consumptive WF of crops (ET / Y). The management practices are four irrigation techniques (furrow, sprinkler, drip and subsurface drip (SSD)), four irrigation strategies (full (FI), deficit (DI), supplementary (SI) and no irrigation), and three mulching practices (no mulching, organic (OML) and synthetic (SML) mulching). Various cases were considered: arid, semi-arid, sub-humid and humid environments in Israel, Spain, Italy and the UK, respectively; wet, normal and dry years; three soil types (sand, sandy loam and silty clay loam); and three crops (maize, potato and tomato). The AquaCrop model and the global WF accounting standard were used to relate the management practices to effects on ET, Y and WF. For each management practice, the associated green, blue and total consumptive WF were compared to the reference case (furrow irrigation, full irrigation, no mulching). The average reduction in the consumptive WF is 8–10 % if we change from the reference to drip or SSD, 13 % when changing to OML, 17–18 % when moving to drip or SSD in combination with OML, and 28 % for drip or SSD in combination with SML. All before-mentioned reductions increase by one or a few per cent when moving from full to deficit irrigation. Reduction in overall consumptive WF always goes together with an increasing ratio of green to blue WF. The WF of growing a crop for a particular environment is smallest under DI, followed by FI, SI and rain-fed. Growing crops with sprinkler irrigation has the largest consumptive WF, followed by furrow, drip and SSD. Furrow irrigation has a smaller consumptive WF compared with sprinkler, even though the classical measure of ""irrigation efficiency"" for furrow is lower.",https://www.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/19/4877/2015/hess-19-4877-2015.pdf,

The sewage and other industrial effluents are being used to irrigate of agricultural fields. This study was undertaken to investigate the effect of continuous application of sewage-effluent irrigation on the DTPA-extractable Cd, Ni, Cr and Pb in soils and crops. For this purpose, periurban agricultural lands irrigated by different sewage effluent, from a point of entering the effluents to a distance of nearly 1.5 km and one irrigated by ground water from different parts of Aligarh district were selected where vegetable crops have successfully been grown. The data indicated that the concentration of these metals in sewage effluent irrigated soils became four to six folds in comparison to ground water irrigated soil. The data also denote that with increas- ing soil depth and distance from sewage entry point the concentration of these metals decreased indicating a low mobility of these metals in soils. Soil properties viz organic carbon, pH, EC and CEC exhibited positive relationship with DTPA- extractable metal content, while clay content showed a negative relationship. The concentrations of Cd, Ni, Cr and Pb in different vegetable crops grown on sewage effluent irrigated soils were higher (beyond permissible limit) as compared to those grown on ground water irrigated soils. The maximum accumulation of these metals were in potato followed by maize except for Pb.

To examine the application of BCW and woodchip biochar (BIO) in agroecosystems, secondary data from literature on environmental (soil, air and water) aspects were compiled with primary agronomic data from a 3-year multicropping field trial and collated with supplementary data on economic factors (e.g. cost and availability). For the field trial, replicated plots were amended with FYM (for comparative reasons), BCW and BIO at 30, 24.2 and 12.8 for t ha–1, respectively, with and without NPK and cultivated in a cropping sequence of maize, potato and barley. At the end of each season, soils were characterised for pH, cation exchange capacity (CEC) and fertility (macronutrient contents) in addition to nutrient uptake, nutritional quality and yield of crops. Compared with FYM, biochar and BCW were found to be associated with greater improvements in soil quality (e.g. building of soil structure and C sequestration) and knock-on water and air quality benefits mainly facilitated via increased cation retention and humic-linked sorption which abated gaseous emission and mitigated nutrient and heavy metal leaching. These along with variable improvements in soil chemistry, fertility and nutrient uptake in the agronomic field trial accounted for increased mean crop yield across treatments (higher with NPK): FYM (32.7 and 71.7%), BCW (33.5 and 60.1%) and BIO (21.8 and 48.2%). Additionally, biochar and BCW have lower pollutant (e.g. heavy metals) contents and were found to provide additional sustainability and net abatement cost-benefits. While the agronomic benefits of biochar and BCW were slightly lower compared with that of FYM, their lower environmental footprints and associated sustainability benefits are clear advantages for their adoption in environmental and agricultural applications.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11270-021-05044-z.pdf,

However, without unified water resources management policy to redistribute the saved agricultural water, farmers’ behavior will lead to water rebound and large-scale expansion of cultivated areas, especially on the edge of oasis regions. To solve these issues and promote the sustainable development of water resources, it makes sense to explore the impact of unified water resources management policy from the perspective of farmers’ behavior. This study takes the typical irrigation zone in the Heihe River Basin as a case to discuss the response of farmers’ economic behavior to transferring irrigation water and restricting land reclamation, i.e., the unified water resources management policy with the technical efficiency of crop irrigation improved based on the bio-economic model. The results show that in the case of loosening land constraints, farmers will reuse all the saved water for agricultural production by reclaiming unused land or increasing the area of water-intensive crops (vegetables). Although the policy of restricting land reclamation can restrict land expansion, it cannot avoid water rebound caused by adjusting the crop-planting structure. Farmers’ land-expansion behavior can be largely restricted by transferring the saved irrigation water to non-agricultural sectors in irrigation zones with inadequate water, but to contain land-expansion behavior in irrigation zones with surplus water, the policy of restricting land reclamation must be implemented simultaneously. The study also reveals that farmers will choose to grow more cash crops (seed maize, vegetables, tomato, seed watermelon, potato, and rapeseed) and fewer food crops (wheat, maize) to increase the profit per unit of water in the scenario of loosening land constraints or transferring agricultural water. Furthermore, the study indicates that farmers’ economic income can be decreased or at least not increased with the transfer of agricultural water. Both benefit compensation from non-agricultural sectors and increased non-agricultural income can compensate farmers’ economic loss. Therefore, it is necessary to improve water rights trading systems and increase employment opportunities for surplus agricultural labor to promote economic development in rural areas.",https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/11/7/2096/pdf?version=1554737883,

Based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the Fifth Assessment Report, the climatic projections for RCPs 4.5 and 8.5 for the years 2023–2080 and 2081–2100 were used to determine the patterns of temperature and rainfall in the upper Egypt territory. The CROPWAT model was employed to estimate reference evapotranspiration (ETo) and net irrigation water requirement (NIWR) for the upper Egypt territory key crops sugar cane, potatoes, berseem clover (alfalfa), dry bean, wheat, cotton, maize, and tomato based on the predicted meteorological conditions. Five different scenarios for the key crops' future irrigation needs were calculated. The results reveal that under RCP 4.5 greenhouse emission for the periods 2023–2080 and 2081–2100, respectively, the overall NIWR for all examined crops increases by 5.1 and 5.9% in comparison to the current (2022) total NIWR for all crops.

However, the ways in which these properties are modified by starch concentration and their dependence on amylose content and thermal and hydration properties have not been adequately established so far. An exhaustive study of the pasting and rheological properties of starch gels (maize and rice (normal and waxy in both cases), wheat, potato, and tapioca) at concentrations of 6.4, 7.8, 9.2, 10.6, and 11.9 g/100 g was performed. The results were evaluated in terms of a potential equation fit between each parameter and each gel concentration. The parameters determined for the gels at the studied concentrations were correlated with the hydration properties and thermal properties by applying principal component analysis (PCA). Wheat starch, followed by normal maize and normal rice starches, presented a greater capacity to modulate their gels’ pasting and viscoelastic properties via their concentration in water. On the contrary, the characteristics of waxy rice and maize, potato, and tapioca starches were barely modified by concentration in pasting assays, but the gels of potato and tapioca showed noticeable changes in their viscoelastic properties as functions of concentration. In the PCA plot, the non-waxy cereal samples (wheat, normal maize, and normal rice) were located close to each other. Wheat starch gels were the most dispersed on the graph, which is consistent with the high dependence on the concentration of the gel shown in most of the studied parameters. The waxy starches had close positions not too distant from those of the tapioca and potato samples and with little influence from amylose concentration. The potato and tapioca samples were close to the vectors of the crossover point in rheology and peak viscosity in their pasting properties.

Although national strategies have been implemented to achieve Sustainable Development Goals in agriculture, the potential contributions of crop switching as a promising solution under varying future climate change are still under-explored. Here, we optimize cropping patterns spatially with the targets of enhancing agriculture production, reducing environmental burdens, and achieving sustainable fertilization across different climate scenarios. Compared with current cropping patterns, the optimal crop distributions under different climate scenarios consistently suggest allocating the planting areas of maize and rapeseed to the other crops (rice, wheat, soybean, peanut, and potato). Such crop switching can consequently increase crop production by 14.1%, with accompanying reductions in environmental impacts (8.2% for leached nitrogen and 24.0% for irrigation water use) across three representative Shared Socio-economic Pathways from 2020 to 2100. The sustainable fertilization rates vary from 148–173 kg N ha−1 in 2030 to 213–253 kg N ha−1 in 2070, significantly smaller than the current rate (305 kg N ha−1). These outcomes highlight large potential benefits of crop switching and fertilizer management for improving China's future agricultural sustainability.",,

'Yungay'. Plants started from tissue culture-produced prenuclear minitubers of 'Yun- gay' were subjected to seven treatments, which included noncolonized (non-AMF) plants fertilized with Long Ashton nutrient solution modifi ed to supply P at 11 and 44 µg·mL -1 . All AMF plants received low P (11 µg·mL -1 ) and were inoculated with either a sierra-maize mixed isolate, sierra-papa mixed isolate, pure isolate of G. intraradices, sierra-maize mixed isolate + formononetin, or a sierra-papa mixed isolate + formononetin. Plants were grown in 3-L containers under shade house conditions in Lima, Peru. Non-AMF plants at low P had the poorest growth, while high P plants had the greatest overall growth. All AMF plants had greater growth, including a higher root to shoot ratio, higher phosphorus use effi ciency ((g tuber)/(g P/kg tissue)), and a lower leaf to tuber ratio (indicating greater leaf effi ciency in producing tuber dry matter), compared to non-AMF plants at low P. The mycorrhizal inoculation effect (MIE) ranged from +44% to +57%, indicating that 'Yungay' was mod- erately to highly mycorrhizal dependent. Plants colonized with the sierra-papa isolate + formononetin had the same tuber development and leaf to tuber ratio, compared to high P, non-AMF plants. Formononetin increased extraradical hyphae formation. Mycorrhizal enhancement was in part due to greater P, Fe, and Mg uptake, a higher phosphorus-use effi ciency and greater extraradical hyphae formation. vegetable crops, i.e., its N, P, and K require- ments are respectively 100%, 100%, and 33% greater than that required for tomato or pepper plant production (Maynard and Hochmuth, 1997). Normal fertilizer applications are around 1000 kg·ha -1 of 10-30-10 (10N-12.9P-8.3K). Subsistence growers may not have access or be able to afford suitable organic or inorganic fertil- izers. Modern sustainable agriculture systems are increasingly using reduced fertility inputs. Hence, there are excellent opportunities to in- corporate arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) as biofertilizers to enhance crop productivity and reduce fertilizer inputs. AMF increase nutrient and water uptake, alleviate cultural and environmental stresses and enhance disease resistance and plant health (Bethlenfalvay and Linderman, 1992; Davies, et al., 1993, 1996; Pfl eger and Linderman, 1994). AMF can enhance productivity of potatoes (Gra- ham et al., 1976; Niemira et al., 1995). In part this may be due to enhanced nutrient uptake of potato plants, particularly P (Black and Tinker, 1977; McArther and Knowles, 1993), as well as enhanced disease resistance (Niemira et al., 1996). In Columbia, experiments show that a considerable amount of P fertilizer can be saved when potatoes are inoculated with effective AMF (Sieverding, 1991). The highlands of Peru and Bolivia are the center of origin and diversity of the cultivated potato. Potato is the main staple crop in the highlands and accounts for 63% gross value of all crop production (Devaux et al., 1997).

Plastic film mulched ridge-furrow is one of the most widely adopted agronomic and field management practices in rain-fed agriculture in dry-land areas of China. The efficiency of plastic film mulching as a viable method to decrease evapotranspiration (ET), increase crop yields, and water use efficiency (WUE), has been demonstrated extensively by earlier studies. Methods A comprehensive evaluation of how co-application of plastic-film mulch and biochar in different agro-environments under varying climatic conditions influence ET, crop yield, WUE, and soil microbial activity were assessed. We performed a meta-analysis using the PRISMA guideline to assess the effect of plastic-film mulched ridge-furrow and biochar on ET, yield, and WUE of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), potato (Solanum tuberosum L.), and maize (Zea mays L.) in northern China. Results The use of plastic film increased average yields of wheat (75.7%), potato (20.2%), and maize (12.9%) in Gansu, Ningxia, Shaanxi, and Shanxi provinces, respectively due to the reduction in ET by 12.8% in Gansu, 0.5% in Ningxia, and 4.1% in Shanxi, but increased in Shaanxi by 0.5% compared to no-mulching. These changes may be attributed to the effect of plastic film mulch application which simultaneously increased WUE by 68.5% in Gansu, 23.9% in Ningxia, 16.2% in Shaanxi, and 12.8% in Shanxi, respectively. Compared to flat planting without mulching, in three years, the yield of maize increased with the co-application of plastic film and biochar by 22.86% in the Shanxi and Shaanxi regions.

Owing to the large number of irrigated small-scale farms that grow different crops across all seasons in the Mutale River catchment, this study sought to develop irrigation scheduling for these crops for sustainable water utilization without compromising crop yields. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images were utilized as the base from which crop water content patterns were derived. A total of four (4) spectral vegetation indices, viz, the Greenness Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GNDVI), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Red-Edge Index (NDRE), and Optimized Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (OSAVI), were generated to characterize crop types and water content in this study. Crop water content data, in the form of the relative water content (RWC), were measured in the field for each type of crop. Crop water content was modelled based on the empirical relationships between spectral indices and field-measured RWC. The linear regression analysis revealed a significant association between the GNDVI and the water content of sweet potato, maize, sugar beans, and Florida broadleaf mustard, with r2 values of 0.948, 0.995, 0.978, and 0.953, respectively. The NDVI revealed a strong association with the water content of Solanum retroflexum, pepper, and cabbage, with r2 values of 0.949, 0.956, and 0.995, respectively. The NDRE, on the other hand, revealed a strong relationship with water content in peas and green beans, with r2 values of 0.961 and 0.974, respectively.

To shed light on this point, we analyze the farm gate prices of twelve representative crops in the period 1991-2016, considering data from 162 countries in total. The crop price dependence on the water footprint is investigated, also accounting for the country’s water scarcity as a possible additional determinant of the price, and of the land footprint as a possible confounding factor. We find that prices of staple crops (e.g. wheat, maize, soybeans, and potatoes) typically embed the amount of water used for their production. Differently, food products that do not contribute in an essential way to the human diet and whose production is more export-oriented (e.g. coffee, cocoa beans, tea, vanilla) exhibit weaker or negligible water-price links. These variations may be ascribable to specific market dynamics related to the two product groups. Staple crops are often produced in markets where many producers have more space for price setting and may have an incentive to include also the value of water in the final crop price. In contrast, cash crops are cultivated in situations where few producers are ‘price takers’ with respect to the international market. This mechanism may decrease the influence of the water used on crop farm gate price composition. The understanding of different water impacts on crop prices may be useful for increasing efficiency in water allocation and governance decisions, with the aim of improved environmental sustainability in this domain.",https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/aba782,

Lipoxy genase (LOX) (linoleate: oxygen oxido reductase; EC:1.13.11.12) discovered first time in 1928 by Haas and Bohn when they observe the loss of yellow color from wheat flour sample after adding small amount of soybean flour. Lipoxy genase is a group of oxidized enzyme including nonhemiiron atom in its effective atom as well as it is stimulates to molecular of oxygen. These enzymes are link the oxygen with unsaturated fatty acid such as arachidonic and linolenic and linoleic to produced peroxides and hydroperoxides, these free radicals are able to oxidase the sulpha hydreal groups of wheat flour proteins and form bi-sulphide bonds which strengthen the gluten, they found that the LOX extracted from soybeans for bleaching and increase the stability of wheat flour and improvement the rheological properties. LOX plays an important role in developing the flavor compounds such as the carbonate and alcohol compounds through produced of different type of peroxides isomers, which contain one of flavor compounds. LOX has special importance to produce aromatic compounds because it gives unique properties because it range of hydroperoxide isomers .LOX it exist widely in plant and animal kingdom and Micro-organisms. LOX differs in substrate so essential fatty acids exist naturally such as linoleic acid (18: 2) and acid linolenic (18: 3) and arachidonic acid works as enzymes substrate . Due to the lack of studies in LOX production from Micro-organisms in Iraq and because of the importance of this enzyme, and its role in food products, So this study aims to obtain some local fungal isolates for LOX production.

A field experiment was conducted in Mu Us Sandy Land to explore the effects of blended guest materials (red clay and loess) with sand at four volume ratios (1:1, 1:2, 1:3 and 1:5) on crop yields, soil properties, and root growth. Red clay and loess significantly increased clay and silt contents and regulated the soil total nitrogen concentration and organic matter content during the critical growth stage of maize. Red clay and loess had a significant promotion of maize and soybean yields at a volume ratio of 1:3. The maximum potato yield was 42,501 and 37,332 kg ha−1 in red clay treatment at a volume ratio of 1:5 and in loess treatment at a volume ratio of 1:3, respectively. Lowest root biomass in surface soil and surface/subsoil root biomass ratio mediated maize growth in red clay treatment.

A novel approach for the calculation of WB was employed, which combined the FAO-56 method for crop water requirements (CWRs) with sources of available water from precipitation, soil, and groundwater. The computed WB was divided into four categories of soil water availability based on soil hydrolimits and crop features: Categories 1 and 2 with zero or mild occurrence of crop water stress; categories 3 and 4 with intermediate and severe occurrence of crop water stress. The winter crops were affected by water stress to a lesser extent (the area of categories 3 and 4: wheat 20.1%, oilseed rape 14.5%) as compared with spring crops (the area of categories 3 and 4: maize 39.6%, potatoes 41%).

A literature review was done to appraise the agronomical research works on major field crops and cropping systems at IAAS, Rampur, Chitwan, Nepal. The objectives were to summarize the results of various agronomic research works at the institute to determine the extent and causes of yield gaps of major crops, and to identify the future research priorities. The review revealed that the on-station research at IAAS in the past were conducted on 14 crops, on maize-and wheat-based systems and on 5 major themes. The main themes of research in most crops were varietal evaluation and breeding, crop management, soil management, weed management and pest management though in some crops research was conducted on other themes too. A total of 81 studies were conducted on various crops, of which 48 were on cereals, 14 on legumes, 10 on oilseed crops, and 6 on potato. There were 2 studies on wheat-based and a single study on maize-based systems. Average potential yields of rice, maize and wheat were 5.5, 4.4 and 5.0 t/ha, while research station yields and farmers' field yields of these crops were 3.4, 3.3 and 3.5 t/ha and 2.7, 1.8 and 1.9 t/ha, respectively, in Chitwan. The yield gaps between the potential and farmers' field for those crops were 2.76, 2.58 and 3.15 t/ha, while those between potential and research station yields were 2.1, 1.1 and 1.53 t/ha, respectively. The gaps between research station and farmers' field yields were much smaller in rice (0.66 t/ha) than in maize (1.48 t/ha) and wheat (1.62 t/ha). The results suggest that there is a great scope to raise yields of all cereals in farmers’ fields, more so for wheat and maize than for rice. Improved agronomical research on rice varieties and crop and soil management required to reduce the yield gap for rice, while adoption of recommended technologies by farmers would help reduce yield gap in wheat. For soybean, lentil, and potato, the gap between potential and farmers’ yields is much larger than the other yield gaps suggesting large scope for increase in yields in farmers’ fields through both improved management and improved varieties. Innovative and new researches on eco-region suited variety identification, improved crop and soil management, improved water and N management and on agro-meteorology and crop modeling are suggested as priorities for future research to uplift the productivity and reduce yield gaps of major crops in Chitwan district of Nepal.

Reducing the water footprint (WF) of the process of growing irrigated crops is an indispensable element in water management, particularly in water-scarce areas. To achieve this, information on marginal cost curves (MCCs) that rank management packages according to their cost-effectiveness to reduce the WF need to support the decision making. MCCs enable the estimation of the cost associated with a certain WF reduction target, e.g. towards a given WF permit (expressed in m3  ha−1 per season) or to a certain WF benchmark (expressed in m3  t−1 of crop). This paper aims to develop MCCs for WF reduction for a range of selected cases. AquaCrop, a soil-water-balance and crop-growth model, is used to estimate the effect of different management packages on evapotranspiration and crop yield and thus the WF of crop production. A management package is defined as a specific combination of management practices: irrigation technique (furrow, sprinkler, drip or subsurface drip); irrigation strategy (full or deficit irrigation); and mulching practice (no, organic or synthetic mulching). The annual average cost for each management package is estimated as the annualized capital cost plus the annual costs of maintenance and operations (i.e. costs of water, energy and labour). Different cases are considered, including three crops (maize, tomato and potato); four types of environment (humid in UK, sub-humid in Italy, semi-arid in Spain and arid in Israel); three hydrologic years (wet, normal and dry years) and three soil types (loam, silty clay loam and sandy loam). For each crop, alternative WF reduction pathways were developed, after which the most cost-effective pathway was selected to develop the MCC for WF reduction. When aiming at WF reduction one can best improve the irrigation strategy first, next the mulching practice and finally the irrigation technique. Moving from a full to deficit irrigation strategy is found to be a no-regret measure: it reduces the WF by reducing water consumption at negligible yield reduction while reducing the cost for irrigation water and the associated costs for energy and labour. Next, moving from no to organic mulching has a high cost-effectiveness, reducing the WF significantly at low cost. Finally, changing from sprinkler or furrow to drip or subsurface drip irrigation reduces the WF, but at a significant cost.",https://www.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/21/3507/2017/hess-21-3507-2017.pdf,

Advantages of having a brand loyal customer base include lower sensitivity to price increases, lower brand switching intentions, high level of customer word-of-mouth marketing exposure and increased consumer profitability. The main focus of this study is to measure the brand loyalty of the KwaZulu-Natal consumers towards their uncooked chicken brand of choice using a validated model and its measuring instrument. The model was developed to measure brand loyalty in the fastmoving consumer goods industry but also successfully applied in agriculture, financial services and other industries. The model measures twelve of the most important antecedents influencing brand loyalty, namely perceived value, brand relevance, brand trust, repeat purchase, switching cost, brand affect, brand commitment, involvement, brand performance, relationship proneness, customer satisfaction and culture. The empirical study was conducted amongst 112 consumers in the KwaZulu-Natal Province of South Africa. A convenience sample was used to collect data through a product-specific adapted questionnaire designed to test how strongly each of the twelve antecedents relates to KwaZulu-Natal’s consumer loyalty towards its chicken brand. The sample showed the appropriate adequacy, had low sphericity and were proved to be reliable as measured by Cronbach Alpha coefficients. The empirical results confirm the importance of each brand loyalty antecedent in chicken brands. This study offers the most important brand loyalty antecedents as a managerial guideline to chicken brands for consideration to implement in their customer loyalty marketing strategies.

Agriculture has the most possibilities compared to the other two sectors. Furthermore, agriculture and agroprocessing are anticipated to create at least one million jobs by 2030. The South African agricultural sector is also vital regarding their role in food security, rural development and poverty alleviation (Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, 2017:8). Employment in the agricultural segment increased by 5% to 849 000 employees in the third to last quarter of 2017 (Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, 2017:9). South African agriculture is confronted by increasing costs of production attributed largely to the high prices of inputs (fertilisers, seed and pesticides), electricity, fuel, mechanisation and labour. There are also additional challenges like frequent drought spells and outbreaks of pests and diseases. In the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries’ Annual Report for 2016/2017, Minister Zokwana said that the government initiated and funded drought-relief programmes worth R263 million. This followed the 2016 season was classified as one of the worst droughts the country has experienced since 1904 (Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, 2017:13). Journal of Business and Retail Management Research (JBRMR), Vol. 14 Issue 1 October 2019 www.jbrmr.com A Journal of the Centre for Business & Economic Research (CBER) 80 The regulatory agricultural environment has also changed dramatically since the onset of democracy in 1994. Government subsidies have been discontinued and commercial farmers are now more price sensitive. In addition to the rising farm expenditure, and specifically labour costs regulated by the minimum wage legislation, farming activities shifted towards mechanisation and the use of capital intensive buying behaviour of farmers (Grainger, 2018). On the political front, the announcement of President Cyril Ramaphosa in December 2017 at the ruling party’s conference that Land Expropriation without Compensation was going to be phased in after the Election in 2019, are a major concern for farmers. This, in conjunction with continued pressure on land reform from Julius Malema, leader of the opposing Economic Freedom Front party, have increased uncertainty in farming (The South African, 2019). Furthermore, the uncertain safety situation on farms and high volume of farm attacks (108) and murders (57.4%) (for the period March 2017 to March 2018) also have a negatively influence farm investments (Head, 2018). As a result, investment and capital expenditure in farming is limited because farmers are unsure of their fate in the future (Bisschoff & Grainger, 2019:4). The Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (2018:10) also reported that the agricultural sector succeeded to contribute 2.4% to the Gross Domestic Product in 2017. The total worth of agricultural production for 2017 was valued at R277,6 billion; this is 8,4% higher than the previous year. The total worth of animal products contributed R137 billion, contributing nearly 50% to the overall agricultural value (Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, 2018:12). The Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries is continuously aiming to implement strategies to expand the sector. Table 1 below shows some of the focus areas and accompanying forecasts of expansion in the agricultural sector. Table 1: Expansion of the Agricultural Sector Focus Area From 2012 To Increase number of Agricultural Smallholders 171,670 471,670 (2019) Increase value-added activities of sectors R42.5 billion R48.9 billion (2019) Increase the average value of annual exports R5.1 billion R5.8 billion (2019) The decrease in the average value of annual imports of diesel, fertiliser and machinery R9.6 billion R7.4 billion (2019) Increase the number of jobs in the sector 660,000 1 million (2030) The ZAR traded at $14,87 US Agriculture in the KwaZulu-Natal province Agriculture has always been a major contributor to KwaZulu-Natal’s economy, especially as KwaZulu-Natal is reckoned to be South Africa’s best watered province and boasting 6.5 million hectares of high-quality agricultural land. The area between Pietermaritzburg and the Drakensberg, known as the Midlands, is regarded as the heart of the province’s agricultural area. The North Coast region is another area of importance where several national leading agricultural products are produced. Some 82% of the province’s agricultural land is fit for extensive livestock production, while 18% of this region have arable land. Even though KwaZulu-Natal covers a small portion of South African borders, a substantial proportion of the nation's small-scale farmers are based here. The diversity of the province’s agriculture is also of note and relates to the patterns of the province’s topography. KwaZulu-Natal has specialist capabilities in several agricultural products as a result of its decent and reliable rainfall throughout the year and its fertile soils (KwaZulu-Natal Top Business, 2018). The main focus of KwaZulu-Natal’s agricultural sector consists of the following: • Horticulture: Sub-tropical fruits, especially bananas, pineapples, cashew nuts, potatoes and other vegetables. • Crops: Sugar and maize • Forestry: Black wattle, SA pine, eucalyptus, saligna and poplar. • Animal husbandry: poultry, beef, sheep (mutton and wool) and pigs (KwaZulu-Natal Top Business, 2018). Problem statement The South African uncooked chicken market, consisting of chicken pieces and also whole birds, is affected by feed cost that have increased significantly. The cost of feeding a chicken has increased by 157% Journal of Business and Retail Management Research (JBRMR), Vol. 14 Issue 1 October 2019 www.jbrmr.com A Journal of the Centre for Business & Economic Research (CBER) 81 from 2001 to 2012, while the selling price of a chicken remains under pressure due to cheap imports. During the same period, chicken prices have risen by only 61% (Davids et al., 2015:73). To survive and remain competitive, South African chicken producers are forced to continuously improve on efficiency and constantly generating new competitive strategies to attract new customers and maintain their current customer base (Esterhuizen, 2006:1). One such strategy is to effectively brand chicken products and target the different brands to specific market segments to acquiring a competitive advantage by creating a brand loyal customer base (Jandaghi et al., 2011:153). Kyriakidis and Rach (2010:7) among many other strategist’s state that there are many advantages in creating brand loyal customers. One such advantage is that such customers are usually less sensitive to price escalations of and loyal customers are also prepared to pay a premium price to obtain their brand of choice. By creating a strong brand and loyal customers, brand management can become a strategic thrust toward profitability. However, to effectively manage a brand and its loyalty, management must measure the levels of brand management across several key brand loyalty indicators (Moolla and Bisschoff, 2012a:342). This is where the problem in the chicken industry lies. There is no tailor-made model to measure brand loyalty in the chicken industry. This study then proposes to address the above problem by using a South African brand loyalty model developed for the fast-moving consumer goods industry, to measure the brand loyalty of uncooked chicken brands in KwaZulu-Natal. Objectives of the study 1. The primary objective of this study will be to measure the brand loyalty of KwaZulu-Natal consumers towards their chicken brand. 2. The secondary objectives are to: 3. Confirm the statistical validity of the twelve brand loyalty antecedents; 4. Measure the brand loya",http://jbrmr.com/cdn/article_file/2019-09-29-09-34-04-AM.pdf,

This experiment included mechanized no-tillage potato planting with corn straw mulch covering (JG), plastic film mulching (HM), and open flat planting (CK). The results showed that mechanical no-tillage with straw mulching significantly affected soil water content in the 0–100 cm soil layer, yield, and water use efficiency (p < 0.05). There was no significant difference in yield between JG and HM, but it was significantly higher than that of CK. The yield of JG was 3.09~12.27% higher than that of CK. The yield increase was mainly achieved by increasing the potato weight per plant (0.697~0.862 **) and the average single potato weight (0.048~0.631). The tuber weight per plant was positively correlated with the plant height at the seedling stage (0.03~0.92 **) and positively correlated with the dry weight of stems and leaves at the tuber expansion stage and starch accumulation stage (0.74 **~0.95 **). It was negatively correlated with the number of branches at the tuber formation stage (−0.33~−0.88 **). Compared with CK, JG could significantly improve the water use efficiency of potatoes and reduce water consumption during the whole growth period of crops. In 2021, JG was 6.5% higher than CK, and HM was 6.88% lower than CK. In 2022, JG and HM increased water use efficiency by 26.17% and 14.50% compared with CK. When HM is applied in heavy soil areas, soil compaction can easily occur, which affects seedling emergence and reduces yield. At the same time, JG has strong adaptability to soil types and good yield stability. It can be seen that JG is a green and efficient mechanized potato cultivation technology suitable for dry farming areas.",https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy14081711,

To reverse the trend, we examined whether alternative crop rotations could save water. Moisture contents were measured weekly at 20 cm intervals in the top 180 cm of soil as part of a 12-year field experiment with four crop rotations: sweet potato→ cotton→ sweet potato→ winter wheat-summer maize (SpCSpWS, 4-year cycle); peanuts → winter wheat-summer maize (PWS, 2-year cycle); ryegrass–cotton→ peanuts→ winter wheat-summer maize (RCPWS, 3-year cycle); and winter wheat-summer maize (WS, each year). We found that, compared to WS, the SpCSpWS annual evapotranspiration was 28% lower, PWS was 19% lower and RCPWS was 14% lower. The yield per unit of water evaporated improved for wheat within any alternative rotation compared to WS, increasing up to 19%. Average soil moisture contents at the sowing date of wheat in the SpCSpWS, PWS, and RCPWS rotations were 7, 4, and 10% higher than WS, respectively. The advantage of alternative rotations was that a deep rooted crop of winter wheat reaching down to 180 cm followed shallow rooted crops (sweet potato and peanut drawing soil moisture from 0 to 120 cm). They benefited from the sequencing and vertical complementarity of soil moisture extraction. Thus, replacing the traditional crop rotation with cropping system that involves rotating with annual shallow rooted crops is promising for reducing groundwater depletion in the North China Plain.",https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2017.00980/pdf,

Global sustainable agricultural systems are under threat, due to projected increases of co-occurring drought and salinity with climate change. Combined effects of drought and salinity on agricultural crops have traditionally been evaluated in small-scale experimental studies. As such the need exists for large scale studies that increase our understanding and assessment of the combined impacts in agricultural practice in real life scenarios. This study aims to provide a new approach to estimate and compare the impacts of drought, salinity and their combination on crop traits at large spatial (138.74 km2) and temporal extents in the Netherlands using remote sensing observations. Specifically, for both maize and potato, we calculated five functional traits from Sentinel-2 observations, namely: leaf area index (LAI), the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR), the fraction of vegetation cover (FVC), leaf chlorophyll content (Cab) and leaf water content (Cw). Individual and combined effects of the stresses on the seasonal dynamics in crop traits were determined using both one-way and two-way ANOVAs. We found that both stresses (individual and co-occurring) affected the functional traits of both crops significantly (with R2 ranging from 0.326 to 0.796), though with stronger sensitivities to drought than to salinity. While we found exacerbating effects within co-occurrent stresses, the impact-level depended strongly on the moment in the growing season. For both crops, LAI, FAPAR and FVC dropped the most under severe drought stress conditions. The patterns for Cab and Cw were more inhibited by co-occurring drought and salinity. Consequently, our study constitutes a way towards evaluating drought and salinity impacts in agriculture with the possibility of potential large-scale application for a sustainable food security.",https://hess.copernicus.org/articles/26/4537/2022/hess-26-4537-2022.pdf,

Its specifi c taste and curative eff ects result from the presence of mustard glycosides (glucosinolates) that may also show nematocidic eff ects. The aim of this study was to evaluate the eff ect of watercress eluate and juice on tomato plants inoculated with the northern root-knot nematode (NRKN) Meloidogyne hapla. It was found out that a er the treatment of plants with solutions derived from watercress the yield of fruit was highly signifi cantly increased. The highest yield increase (by 96 % to 165 %) was observed in the variant with the highest concentration of watercress extracts (macerate + 200 ml of juice). Although at lower concentrations of watercress solution the increase in yields was also reduced (by 57–118 %), the diff erence was still statistically highly signifi cant. The eff ect of this treatment on the content of vitamin C was similar and the increase was also highly signifi cant and ranged from 24 to 67 %. When evaluating the occurrence of nematodes on roots of tomato plants, the presence of pathogens was equal to zero percent in all treated variants. The treatment with this phytosolution corroborated not only a nematocidic eff ect of watercress but also its positive infl uence on the yield and level of vitamin C in dependence on increasing concentrations of the eff ective agent. It can be therefore concluded that the watercress solution showed a promoting eff ect on tomato plants. watercress, nematocidic eff ects, tomato, yield, vitamin C The watercress Nasturtium offi cinale R. Br. is a member of Brassicaceae family and is cultivated as a perennial, nutritionally valuable and tasty forced vegetable that is popular in a number of countries. It is rich in chemoprotective substances. The watercress contains in 1 kg of fresh leaves 620 mg of vitamin C, 14.6 mg of vitamin E as well as members of B-group vitamins; of minerals, it contains 1,700 mg Ca, 520 mg P, 2,300 mg K, 22 mg Fe, 150 mg Mg, 7 mg Zn, traces of Se (KOPEC, 1998), and 30 mg of beta carotene (VOGEL, 1996). As all members of Brasicaceae family, it contains also glucosinolates (mustard oil glucosides), which show a specifi c composition typical for each individual plant species. The high number of glucosinolates is a consequence of chemical diversity of their side chain (R-group), which is derived from several amino acids. In plant tissues, glucosinolates are accompanied with the enzyme myrosinase, which catalyses their decomposition. Isothiocyanates and nitrils are the most frequent products of this decomposition and they considerably contribute to the typical burning taste of vegetables from the Brassicaceae family. In addition to an intensive sensory activity, thiocyanates show also a number of toxic and other pharmacological eff ects. They are slightly strumigenous and some of them show marked antimicrobial, insecticidic, fungicidic and nematicidal eff ects so that they can be used for the sanitation of soil. Some products of glucosinolates decomposition (e.g. gluconasturtiin in watercress or glucorafanin that can be found out above all in broccoli) show anti-carcinogenic eff ects and reduce the risk of the occurrence of chemicallyinduced cancer (VELÍŠEK, HAJŠLOVÁ, 2009). A similar conclusion was published by MURPHY et al. (2001) who studied eff ects of phenylethyl isothiocynate produced by hydrolysis of watercress 234 Helena Zahradníková, Kristína Petříková gluconasturtiin. Also cyanides originating from cyanogenic glycosides (thiocyanates – rhodanid), which are either products of their metabolism or result from the decomposition of glucosinolates contained in some vegetables, may show toxic eff ects (VELÍŠEK, HAJŠLOVÁ, 2009). Watercress extracts are used also for therapeutic purposes under commercial names amarum, cholagogum, metabolicum and roborans (RUBATZKY, YAMAGUCHI, 1999). In the period of growth, the leaves and stems might be contaminated by Fasciola hepatica. The preventive measures against human fascioliasis consist of prohibition of eating watercress in endemic areas of its occurrence (MAS-C OMA et al., 2005). Nematicidal eff ects of watercress against rootknot nematodes Meloidogyne ssp. were described by KONONKOV et al. (1997) and TOENSMEIER (2007). Similar eff ects were observed a er the application of phytoncides derived from other essentialoils containing plant species, e.g. Allium cepa, A. sativum, Menta spicata, Tagetes erecta, Nigella sativa, and Azadirachta indica (ABO-ELYOUSR et al., 2009) or Thymus vulgaris, Artemisia absinthum and Punica granatum (KORAYEM et al., 1993; LASHEIN, 2002). A er their application, both the health condition of plants and yields improved. Members of the genus Meloidogyne sp. infest a wide spectrum of guest plants (above all potatoes, carrots, cucumbers, lettuce, gherkins, tomatoes and scorsonera). Roots of infested plants are shorter, with a high number of small roots, on which there are knots (cecidia) of various size, fi lled up with fungal tissue. In crop stands they occur in typical foci and the only method of plant protection is to include some non-guest plants (e.g. maize, rye or raps) into the crop rotation. In greenhouses, it is necessary to use and maintain lower soil temperatures. As a tool of biological control of nematodes (ROD et al., 2005) fungi of the genus Arthrobotrys sp. can be also used. MATERIALS AND METHODS The experiment was established in Lednice in the greenhouse of the Faculty of Horticulture Mendel University in Brno, within the period of 2005– 2006. Seedlings of tall tomato variety Tornado F1 (originating from Semo Smržice) were cultivated from sowings performed on 17 March 2005 and 12 March 2006. On 18 May 2005 and 14 May 2006, these seedlings were planted into pots with the volume of 25 litres, which contained 10 kg of soil substrate. Pots were placed into a cold greenhouse on tables covered with fi ve layers of hardened PVC foil welded on edges to prevent greenhouse contamination with nematodes. During the cultivation period, the greenhouse temperature ranged from 22 to 28 °C, the relative air humidity was 75–80 % and the plants were fertilised with the universal fertiliser called “Kristalon květ a plod“. To prevent the occurernce of Phytopthora infestans, a biological preparation Polyversum 0.01 % was applied and for the protection against aphids the preparation Pirimor 0.02% was used. Individuals of the northern root-knot nematode Meloidogyne hapla originated from the Parasitological Institute of the Biological Centre, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic in České Budějovice and were applied into pots in the form of a solution containing approximately 300 invasive larvae in 200 ml of solution applied into each pot. Inoculated were all pots (including control). The macerate was prepared from 1 kg of fresh leaves placed into three litre of water and the juice was obtained by means of squeezing (Juicer Omega). The fi nal phyto-solution was applied three times in the dose of 2 litres per pot and in intervals of four weeks (HASABO and NOWEER, 2005). Established were the following experimental variants: Variant 1: Control Variant 2: Application of water cress macerate plus 200 ml of juice Variant 3: Application of water cress macerate diluted with water (1:2) plus 100 ml of juice Variant 4: Application of water cress macerate diluted with water (1:4) plus 20 ml of juice. The experiment was established in three replications and in each of them there were three tomato plants. Fruits were harvested during the whole period of cultivation, which in individual years was fi nished on 26 September 2005 and 27 September 2006, respectively. In addition of evaluation of yields, harvested fruits were analysed for the content of vitamin C using the HPLC method. A er the end of the experiment, the presence of northern root-knot nematode (NRKN) Meloidogyne hapla gall on roots of tomato plants was determined under the microscope OLYMPUS BX 41. Obtained values were analysed statistically using the statistical so ware package UNISTAT v. 453. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION As compared with untreated Control, the treatment of NRKN-inoculated tomato plants with watercress macerate and juice increased signifi cantly yield of fruits. The highest increase (by 96–165 %) was recorded in Variant 2 (i.e. with the highest concentration of the phyto-solution). In Variants 3 and 4, fruit yields were increased by 77–118 % and 57–84 %, respectively. This means that yields increased with the increasing concentration of the phyto-solution (Tab. I, Tab. II). KONONKOV et al. (1997), as well, reported increased yields of tomato fruits and reduced numbers of galls on roots a er the application of watercress juice. As shown in Tab. II, there were not only signifi cant diff erences in yields among individual experimental variants because, with the exception of Variant 3, the fruit yields were signifi cant infl uenced also by the year. Nematocid eff ects of watercress (Nasturtium offi cinale R. Br.) 235 When evaluating numbers of NRKN gall on roots of tomato plants to the end of this experiment, the occurrence of this pathogen was equal to zero in treated experimental variants. Although there were no NRKN gall in any of the treated variants, the highest yield was recorded in Variant 2 (i.e. with the highest concentration of phyto-solution). This means that yields increased in dependence on increasing concentration of the phyto-solution in both years and that the phytoncides contained in watercress plants showed a protective eff ect against NRKN-infestation of tomatoes. Besides, they also showed a promoting eff ect on fruit yields. Basing on this nematicidal eff ect, KONONKOV e",http://acta.mendelu.cz/doi/10.11118/actaun201361010233.pdf,

Linné classified different types of bread, and described their nutritional value and health-related aspects, as well as milling, baking and storing, in detail. While discussing the food habits of social classes Linné accepted as a fact that the peasants and the poor should eat less tasty bread than the rich. The less palatable bread had, however, many nutritional and health advantages. Linné paid much attention to substitutes for grain to be used in times of famine, an important topic in eighteenth century Sweden. He regarded flour made of pine bark or water arum roots as excellent famine food, was enthusiastic about the new plant, maize, but considered potato only as a poor substitute for grain. Linné and his followers praised bread not only as the core component of diet, but also for its versatile role both in health and in disease.",https://doi.org/10.1080/17482970701652245,

The agro-pastoral ecotone (APE) in North China is a main region for potato production. However, potato yield has been seriously constrained by water shortages because of low precipitation and highly variable precipitation patterns during the growing season in this area. In this study, the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) model was used to simulate potato water-limited yield and historical years were divided into different water-temperature year types to optimize the optimal planting period (OPP) and cultivar of potato. The results showed that the potato yield varied in different water-temperature year types. Fast-developing cultivar Favorita could obtain the highest yield in most places and water-temperature year types due to its relatively short length of tuber formation stage. In this study, we suggest changing the planting date according to the water-temperature year type, which offers a new way to adapt to a highly variable climate. However, our method should be adopted carefully because we only considered climate factors; other agronomic management practices (adjusting planting density, plastic film mulch, conservation tillage etc.) also have a great effect on planting date and cultivar selection, which should be further investigated in the future.",https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0472/11/11/1061/pdf?version=1635415736,

The algorithm combines methods of Pareto ranking and Pareto dominance selections to implement a novel selection scheme at each generation. The ability of CPMDE in solving unconstrained, constrained and real-world optimization problems was demonstrated. The two objectives of the model are to maximize total crop net benefit (NB) over a planting season while minimizing total irrigation water allocation. A set of non-dominated solutions with the high NBs at lower irrigation water allocation for three crop types was obtained, and compromise programming approach was used in evaluating the most favourable solution. The best solution shows that maize produced the highest crop yield under limited water allocation in the study area. Comparing this result with that of a previous study which adopted a multi-objective optimization algorithm called multi-objective differential evolution algorithm, CPMDE is a good and robust alternative algorithm suitable for resolving crop distribution under limited water availability.",https://doi.org/10.1080/23311916.2018.1535749,

Potatoes can be a good alternative crop because it is fast maturing. Work was done to evaluate performance of potatoes at Mwea Irrigation Agricultural Development (MIAD) Centre in Kirinyaga County and at National Irrigation Board (NIB) irrigation schemes at Bura and Perkerra between 2013 and 2015. Generally, potato varieties took a shorter time to mature and had lower yields in the irrigation schemes than they normally do in the cool highlands.

During the developmental processes, the main CW components, i.e., cellulose, pectins, hemicelluloses, and different types of CW-glycoproteins, interact constantly with each other and with the environment to maintain cell homeostasis. Differentiation processes are altered by positional effect and are also tightly linked to environmental changes, affecting CW both at the molecular and biochemical levels. The negative effect of climate change on the environment is multifaceted, from high temperatures, altered concentrations of greenhouse gases such as increasing CO2 in the atmosphere, soil salinity, and drought, to increasing frequency of extreme weather events taking place concomitantly, therefore, climate change affects crop productivity in multiple ways. Rising CO2 concentration in the atmosphere is expected to increase photosynthetic rates, especially at high temperatures and under water-limited conditions. This review aims to synthesize current knowledge regarding the effects of climate change on CW biogenesis and modification. We discuss specific cases in crops of interest carrying cell wall modifications that enhance tolerance to climate change-related stresses; from cereals such as rice, wheat, barley, or maize to dicots of interest such as brassica oilseed, cotton, soybean, tomato, or potato. This information could be used for the rational design of genetic engineering traits that aim to increase the stress tolerance in key crops. Future growing conditions expose plants to variable and extreme climate change factors, which negatively impact global agriculture, and therefore further research in this area is critical.",https://www.mdpi.com/2223-7747/9/2/212/pdf?version=1582784682,

The study was also aimed at isolating the most common mycotoxin producing fungi from maize samples collected from the study areas. The post-harvest practices were determined using a questionnaire. From each county, a total of 130 maize samples were collected. The samples from each county were mixed to make a composite sample. The moisture content of the maize samples were determined and percentage moisture content calculated. Each sample was ground using a dry mill kitchen blender (BL335, Kenwood, UK). A sample of 1g was suspended in 9mL of sterile distilled water and serial dilution up to 10 -2 carried out. A sample of 0.01mL was plated on potato dextrose agar. Mycotoxin producing fungi were identified using morphological characteristics and fungal identification keys. The postharvest practices within the counties varied significantly. The mean moisture content of stored maize varied from 16.78% in Kitui to 19.33% in Trans Nzoia. The number of mycotoxin producing fungi ranged from 10.33 CFU/g in Machakos to 61.00CFU/g in Trans Nzoia. This study established that the post-harvest practices observed in the study areas led to contamination of maize with mycroflora.

Climate change will exacerbate the demand for these resources. This paper examines how climate change affects the water demands of Saudi Arabia’s most important food crops: wheat, clover, vegetables, and dates. To reduce the adverse climate change impacts on these crops’ productivity, as well as their irrigation water requirements (IWR), a number of adaptation techniques were investigated. The study was carried out for the Ar Riyadh region, Saudi Arabia, with a cultivated area of 179,730 ha. In this study, five climate models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) for two Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs), SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5, were used to forecast and investigate the potential impacts of climate change on agricultural water resources in the Al-Riyadh Region of Saudi Arabia. To simulate IWRs under the present and projected climate change scenarios, CROPWAT8.0 was used. The results showed that the maximum increase ratio in 2100 under SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5, respectively, will be 4.46% and 12.11% higher than in the current case (2020). The results showed that the projected maximum temperatures in 2100 will be increased by 4.46% and 12.11%, respectively, under SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5, compared to the current case (2020), supporting past research on the Arabian Peninsula that revealed that both short- and long-term temperature increases are anticipated to be considerable. Under SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5, the projected ETo was found to be increased by 2.18% and 6.35% in 2100, respectively. Given that evapotranspiration closely mirrors the temperature behavior in the study region from June to August, our data suggest that crop and irrigation demand may increase in the mid to long term. The findings indicate that Riyadh, Saudi Arabia’s capital and commercial hub, will require more water to irrigate agricultural land because of the expanding ETo trend. Under SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5, the projected growth irrigation water requirement (GIWR) will be increased by 3.1% and 6.7% in 2100, respectively. Under SSP5-8.5, crop areas of wheat, clover, dates, maize, citrus, tomato, potato, and other vegetables in Ar Riyadh will decrease by 6.56%, 7.17%, 5.90%, 6.43%, 5.47%, 6.99%, 5.21%, and 5.5%, respectively, in 2100. Conversely, under SSP2-4.5, the crop areas will decrease by 3.10%, 3.67%, 2.35%, 3.83%, 2.32%, 4.18%, 1.72%, and 2.38% in 2100, respectively.

In this study, a crop simulation model (DSSAT) was used to assess the impact of climate change scenario on rainfed maize and potato in the southern mountain areas in Ningxia. Analysis of observed crop data showed differences between cultivated and harvested areas for both crops in the study area with variations among years. Results from DSSAT model for years showed that it was able to capture the trend of yield over the years realistically well. The model predicted an average yield of maize of 5450 kg/ha, which was close to the average (5446kg/ha) yield reported by the Department of statistics of Ningxia (DOSN) and an average predicted yield of potato was 2350 kg/ha while the DOSN average was 2358 kg/ha, with higher RMSE for maize (1046kg/ha) than for potato (358kg/ha). Predictions of future yield for both crops showed that the responses of maize and potato were different under different climate changes scenarios. The reduction of rainfall by 10-20% reduced the expected yield by 7-12% for maize and 9-18% for potato, respectively. The increase in rainfall by 10-20% increased the expected yield by5-9% for maize and 10-20% for potato, respectively.

We know from Bible that Lentils were also the ingredient of the cultivation and food of ancient Egypt. In Turkey, fossilized seeds of pea, lentils and other leguminous plants have been discovered from the fire places of Neolithic age, approximately 7000 to 8000 years B. C. ago. The human population inhabiting around the lakes during 4000-5000 B.C. in Switzerland, grew peas and a dwarf field bean. Farmers in China started to cultivate soy bean during 2000-3000 B.C. These crops were introduced and then started to cultivate in America and Asia nearly 3,000 years ago. For soil improvement Romans used used legumes in pastures dating 37 B. C. [1]. In Finland, pea cultivation has been documented since the 17th century it was common in the southwest, where soils contained enough clay and arable fields were available, and spread slowly throughout the country [2]. In Sub-Saharan Africa regarding the trends in production, distribution, trade of legumes, the approximate used area for total harvesting of all the leguminous crops was 20 million ha in 2006-2008, which is 28% of total area used for cultivating crops worldwide. From this area, 54% of the area was used for cow peas, 28% for dry beans and 18% for all other lentils. West and Central Africa produced estimated 2.6 million tons of cowpeas on 7.8 million ha  per annum in 1990s, which was about 69% of the global production and harvesting [3].             There is an estimated 10% of pulse contributions to protein intake and the top 16 developing countries out of 28, that are producing these crops, are from Sub-Saharan Africa. The top 5 countries in this list (Braudi, Rwanda, Uganda, Kenya, Comoros) are also in Sub-Saharan Africa. For the production of lentils in Sub- Saharan Africa, the area specified for this purpose is 17% while it is 10% in rest of the world [4]. The land required for the cultivation of legumes is of poor quality, meaning that there are no strict criteria for land and can be grown easily on any type of land. On the other hand, cereals such as wheat, maize, rice, barley requires fertilized land, temperature and humidity-controlled conditions for proper growth and they are also very sensitive crops. Legumes can be grown in areas with scarcity of water and are resistant to tough weather and land conditions. Unfortunately, the pulses and legumes do not get investment, resources and the Governments in most of the countries do not pay much attention to these crops as they are mostly consumed as secondary food while cereals are mostly assumed as priority attention crop. Cereals are considered as food security crops and policies are devised for their growth and protection [5]. The proportions of cultivated legumes have great differences across the world. The cultivation of legumes uses 16% of total cultivated land globally and the soybean crop among these is the most important crop in America in terms of food choice, trade and financial impact. In Europe the area of grain legumes is about 4 million, in this area 8 million t legume seeds are produced. Pea is the dominant legume seed in Europe, which is cultivated on about 1 million ha [6]. Regular consumption o legumes are highly recommended due to their nutritional value among the food stuffs. In Middle Ages, they were one of the most important sources of energy (starch) and protein in the human diet. But now legumes have been replaced by potatoes, food of animal origin or cereals by their role [7]. However, attitudes towards legumes have been improving for some time now, and they are no longer consistently viewed as old-fashioned. The reasons for this are health benefits of legumes are being increasingly recognized and acknowledged [8].",https://www.dietfactor.com.pk/index.php/df/article/download/35/59,

Many of such creaming agents are made from chemicals that are finite, imported, and therefore very expensive and some are toxic to human health and wellbeing. The production of such chemicals leads to a lot of environmental pollution and its attendant degradation and health virus, not to mention their exorbitance. These imported creaming agents are now beyond the reach of smallholder farmers and cottage industrialists. The use of vegetative creaming agents such as locust bean, polysaccharides, tamarind kernel powder, etc. has been reported and practiced and the results have been very good and encouraging (BIS 2001, Blackley, 2010). Fresh, natural rubber latex (FNRL) (with 40% rubber and 60% water) can be processed into concentrated natural rubber latex (CNRL). This is done to meet industrialists' demand, increase its economic value, increase its dry rubber content (DRC) and ease transportation costs. Also, dipped goods usually require a high concentration of DRC and purification too. Products such as hand gloves, condoms, balloons, pillows, mattresses and suckers, teats, and catheters are usually made from concentrated latex. Methods such as centrifugation, evaporation, electro-decantation and creaming are the methods used for purifying and concentrating FNRL. However, due to the cost of most chemicals imported into the country and the high cost of machines also imported, many entrepreneurs have tried to develop green rubber processing methods. These methods do not require the use of big bogus expensive machines. The main object of this project is to develop a system to prepare cream-concentrated natural rubber latex (CNRL) without using sophisticated machines and importing expensive chemicals. We will work on a simple, cheap, green, environmentally and health-friendly method to produce cream CNRL.

The organoleptic assessment method used was hedonic test with scale of 1-5 (very like until very dislike) which had been done by 15 untrained panelists. Data was statisticaly analized by Duncan’s test (5%). Clone 1 and 2 were preferred by panelist as raw material for potato chips, which got score of ‘very like’ until ‘like’ for color, size, taste, and texture parameters. Although there was no significant difference on color and size parameters for all samples of that boiled potato there, however, clone no 8 can be considered as the most favourite based on taste and texture parameters.",https://doi.org/10.1088/1755-1315/58/1/012061,

Quantifying the water demands of major crops and their variations in this region is crucial for the sustainable use of agricultural water resources. Based on meteorological data and crop growth parameters of 21 national weather stations in Hebei Province from 2007 to 2017, this study analyzed the crop water requirement, irrigation water demand, and water deficit index and their dynamic changes for several grain and vegetable crops including winter wheat, summer maize, soybean, potato, tomato, cucumber, eggplant, cowpea, Chinese cabbage, cabbage, and carrot. In addition, regional total irrigation water demands of these water-intensive crops were estimated. The results indicated that, except for summer maize, the crop water requirements and irrigation water demands of grain crops during the growth periods were mostly higher than those of vegetable crops. Winter wheat and cabbage had the highest water deficits among grain and vegetable crops, respectively, while summer maize had the lowest water deficits. Temporally, the irrigation water demands of winter wheat, summer maize, cabbage, and eggplant have increased for years, along with the increase in planting areas. Spatially, the total irrigation water demand in the southeast of Hebei Province was higher than that in the northwest, and the total irrigation water demand of winter wheat was much higher than that of the other crops. To mitigate water scarcity while ensuring food security, the planting areas of crops with higher yields and lower water consumptions, including summer maize, potato, cabbage, and carrot could be appropriately expanded. In contrast, the scale of water-intensive crops such as winter wheat and tomato should be strictly controlled. Our findings will be of great significance for constructing sustainable water-saving cropping systems in a changing climate.",https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4433/13/9/1399/pdf?version=1661920538,

As part of this experiment moisture contents were measured each at 20 cm intervals in the top 1.8 m. Recharge and net water use were calculated based on these moisture measurement. Results showed that winter wheat and ryegrass had the least recharge with an average of 27 mm/year and 39 mm/year, respectively; cotton had the most recharge with an average of 211 mm/year) followed by peanuts with 118 mm/year, sweet potato with 76 mm/year, and summer maize with 44 mm/year. Recharge depended on the amount of irrigation water pumped from the aquifer and was therefore a poor indicator of future groundwater decline. Instead net water use (recharge minus irrigation) was found to be a good indicator for the decline of the water table. The smallest amount of net (ground water) used was cotton with an average of 14 mm/year, followed by peanut with 32 mm/year, summer maize with 71 mm/year, sweet potato with 74 mm/year. Winter wheat and ryegrass had the greatest net water use with the average of 198 mm/year and 111 mm/year, respectively.

The 2020–2021 drought in Madagascar, in particular, is associated with an exceptional food crisis, yet we are unaware of peer-reviewed studies that quantitatively link variations in weather and climate to agricultural outcomes for staple crops in Madagascar. In this study, we use historical data to empirically assess the relationship between soil moisture and food production. Specifically, we focus on major staple crops that form the foundation of Malagasy food systems and nutrition, including rice, which accounts for 46% of the average Malagasy caloric intake, as well as cassava, maize, and sweet potato. Available data associated with survey-based crop statistics constrain our analysis to 2010–2017 across four clusters of Malagasy districts. Strong correlations are observed between remotely sensed soil moisture and rice production, ranging between 0.67 to 0.95 depending on the cluster and choice of crop calendar. Predictions are shown to be statistically significant at the 90% confidence level using bootstrapping techniques, as well as through an out-of-sample prediction framework. Soil moisture also shows skill in predicting cassava, maize, and sweet potato production, but only when the months most vulnerable to water stress are isolated.

The population of Pakistan is increasing so there is a need to share the burden of wheat by developing composite flour. Composite flour is defined as a mixture of flour from starch based-tubers, protein enriched legumes and from other cereals flour in combination with or without wheat flour. Research have been carried out on the utilization of various food items like cassava, yam, sweet potato, maize, rice, sorghum, millet, soya, chick pea, cow pea and peanuts as a substitute of wheat flour (Begum et al., 2013; Ohimain, 2014). Composite flour utilization in development of various food products is an attractive approach to meet the global challenge of protein-calorie malnutrition. To overcome the problem of protein calorie malnutrition and to increase intake of dietary protein in to the diet, the combination of cereal-based products with legumes is of considerable importance. Pulses or legumes are an important source of dietary vegetable protein containing twice the protein content compared to cereal grains. Cereals are deficient in lysine but contain sufficient amount of sulphur containing amino acids. In contrast, legumes contain sufficient lysine but lacking sulphur containing amino acids.

In this area, the land and agricultural productivity is very low because of several constraints, particularly waterlogging, high salinity of soil and water, freshwater scarcity for crop irrigation and natural disaster. In this review, the objectives are to focus on the limiting factors for crop intensifying and highlighting the opportunities to increase coastal agriculture while enhancing farmer’s livelihoods. Some recent studies demonstrated many opportunities for increasing cropping systems that have not yet been exploited extensively. Rainwater or low saline river water storing in the internal canal can fulfil the water requirement for dry season rice and non-rice crops, thereby increasing growth and yield. Early establishment of “Rabi” crops (non-rice) can utilize maximum low-saline soil water and escape high salinity/drought or heat/storms at later period of the growing stages, but this early sown Rabi crops needs early harvest of Aman rice around 15-30 days earlier than farmer practices. Moreover, early sowing by zero tilled dibbling (such as sunflower, maize, wheat, and potato) in wet soils results in higher yield potential. Using rice straw mulch ~5 t ha-1 has been shown to be highly beneficial for ameliorating soil constraints. A recent study revealed that straw mulch application on soil surface increased soil water and soil solute potential in the upper root zone, reduced soil salinity, soil strength, and cracking which attributed to higher yield. Considering the successful dry season crop establishment and yield potential requires early drainage to remove excess soil water and a drainage system that mitigates waterlogging from heavy rainfall events during the growing season. We expect this review will facilitate the future research planning and execution in this vulnerable coastal environment.

There is a great variation between various genera as to their ability to produce a specific enzyme for the production of particular enzymes varies with the particular medium and pH. Place and Duration of Study: The study was conducted at the Department of Microbiology Laboratory, Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University, ATBU, Bauchi Nigeria, from November, 2020 to October, 2021. Aim: This study was aimed to isolates fungi from disposed maize cobs and evaluates its potentials to produce amylase. Methods: Twelve samples each was collected from three different areas; market place, farmland and residential areas in Bauchi metropolis, (a total of 36 samples in all) using precise aseptic techniques. Each sample was collected using clean polythene bag, transported to the lab and aseptically blended. One gram of each sample was aseptically weighed and placed in a test tube containing sterile water; it was then allowed to stand for 30 minutes. One ml of the stock solution was serially diluted and 10ml dilution of each sample was plated on Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) media. The plate was incubated at 25°C within a period of three, five and seven days during which they were monitored and examined, to isolate the required fungi species. The isolates were tested for amylolytic activity using 1% iodine and screen for amylase production by pre-treatment and solid state fermentation, then α-amylase activity finally determined. Results: Amylase-producing fungi were isolated from maize cobs collected from residence, market and farm areas in Bauchi metropolis. The ability of ten (10) fungal isolates recovered, (Mucor racemosus, Aspergillus niger Penicillium chrysogenum, Rhizopus oryzae, Microsporum sp, Trichoderma sp, Nocardia sp, Monilla sp, Fusarium sp and Chaetomum sp) to degrade starch was determined. Three (3) of the fungal isolates Aspergillus niger Penicillium chrysogenum, Rhizopus oryzae, had the highest frequency of (20%) each. Four (4) of the fungal isolates (Mucor racemosus, Aspergillus niger, Penicillium chrysogenum and Rhizopus oryzae) showed zone of clearance on starch agar medium, the fungi isolates were selected and subjected to various temperatures, incubation time and pH ranges for amylase production. The results showed that Penicillium chrysogenum and Rhizopus oryzae have maximum amylase activity at temperature 35°C, incubation time 96hrs (4days), pH 5.5 and temperature 30°C,incubation time 96hrs(4days) and pH 5.0 respectively. Penicillium chrysogenum produced 46.3μ/ml, and Rhizopus oryzae, produced 30.8μ/ml of amylase. Conclusion: The results of this work proved Penicillium chrysogenum to be the best producer of amylase compared to Rhizopus oryzae. Isolation of amylase producing fungi from maize cobs from residence, market and farm areas will help in the bioremediation of environment, which could have caused environmental pollution. It is recommended that Penicillium chrysogenum and Rhizopus oryzae, are suitable fungi for amylase production.

Coinciding with adverse socio-economic conditions, this event triggered the last subsistence crisis in the western World. Here, we model reductions in potential crop yields for 1816 and 1817 and address the question, what impact a similar climatic anomaly would have today. We reconstructed daily weather for Switzerland for 1816/17 on a 2 km grid using historical observations and an analogue resampling method. These data were used to simulate potential crop yields for potato, grain maize, and winter barley using the CropSyst model calibrated for current crop cultivars. We also simulated yields for the same weather anomalies, but referenced to a present-day baseline temperature. Results show that reduced temperature delayed growth and harvest considerably, and in combination with reduced solar irradiance led to a substantial reduction (20%–50%) in the potential yield of potato in 1816. Effects on winter barley were smaller. Significant reductions were also modelled for 1817 and were mainly due to a cold late spring. Relative reductions for the present-day scenario for the two crops were almost indistinguishable from the historical ones. An even stronger response was found for maize, which was not yet common in 1816/17. Waterlogging, which we assessed using a stress-day approach, likely added to the simulated reductions. The documented, strong east-west gradient in malnutrition across Switzerland in 1817/18 could not be explained by biophysical yield limitations (though excess-water limitation might have contributed), but rather by economic, political and social factors. This highlights the importance of these factors for a societies’ ability to cope with extreme climate events. While the adaptive capacity of today’s society in Switzerland is much greater than in the early 19th century, our results emphasize the need for interdisciplinary approaches to climate change adaptation considering not only biophysical, but also social, economic and political aspects.",https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aa7246/pdf,

This study aims at using spatially distributed crop growth simulations to investigate how field‐scale patterns in soil properties obtained using geophysical mapping affect the spatial variability of soil water content dynamics and growth of crops at the square kilometer scale. For this, a geophysics‐based soil map was intersected with land use information. Soil hydraulic parameters were calculated using pedotransfer functions. Simulations of soil water content dynamics performed with the agroecosystem model AgroC were compared with soil water content measured at two locations, resulting in RMSE of 0.032 and of 0.056 cm3 cm−3, respectively. The AgroC model was then used to simulate the growth of sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.), silage maize (Zea mays L.), potato (Solanum tuberosum L.), winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), winter barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), and winter rapeseed (Brassica napus L.) in the 1‐ by 1‐km study area. It was found that the simulated leaf area index (LAI) was affected by the magnitude of simulated water stress, which was a function of both the crop type and soil characteristics. Simulated LAI was generally consistent with the observed LAI calculated from normalized difference vegetation index (LAINDVI) obtained from RapidEye satellite data. Finally, maps of simulated agricultural yield were produced for four crops, and it was found that simulated yield matched well with actual harvest data and literature values.

The Taungya agroforestry system, introduced in Mount Elgon National Park, Uganda, in 2009, aims to address this issue by integrating forest restoration with agricultural production for food security. This study assesses the social and ecological contributions of the Taungya system in Kapkwata sub-county, Kapchorwa district, focusing on its impact on forest cover restoration, food security, income generation, and the provision of ecosystem services. Using a mixed-methods approach, data were collected from 240 participants selected through random sampling, supplemented by key informant interviews. Quantitative data were analyzed using SPSS, and qualitative insights were analyzed through thematic analysis. The results indicate that the Taungya system significantly improved vegetation cover, with the majority of participants reporting an increase in forest cover from 0-25% to 51-75%. The program also contributed to household food security and income generation, with participants cultivating crops like Irish potatoes, maize, and onions for both consumption and sale. Non-crop benefits, including access to firewood and clean water, further enhanced household resilience. However, challenges such as small land allocations, crop pests, and wildlife conflicts were identified as barriers to maximizing the program's impact. To optimize outcomes, the study recommends increased land allocations per household and the introduction of integrated pest management strategies. The findings underscore the potential of agroforestry systems like Taungya to achieve sustainable conservation and community development in protected areas",https://journals.eanso.org/index.php/eajfa/article/download/2307/2979,

First, soil moisture change characteristics were monitored in situ in the field. Second, for soil samples, soil bulk density, porosity, and permeability were analyzed, soil nutrient (K, Na, Ca, and Mg) characteristics were tested and analyzed. Then, we explored the relationship between agroforestry and soil moisture, soil moisture and soil nutrients, soil moisture and precipitation, and agroforestry and soil nutrients. It is shown (1) during the monitored period, variation trends in soil nutrients in four types of agroforestry was small, but it increased/decreased significantly compared with the secondary forest, which the variation range was more than 5%; (2) the changes of soil water content were significantly affected by precipitation, soil porosity and permeability, the moisture content changes of HYM, HTY, YSH, and YMH agroforestry were significantly correlated with precipitation, soil porosity, and permeability; (3) under the same precipitation conditions, different types had different lags on soil water regulation, with the average HYM 0.8 h, HTY 0.6 h, YSH 0.3 h, and YMH 0.4 h, each type soil responded at 2–3 h after rain, and the soil moisture content returned to the normal level; and (4) the variation of soil moisture content fluctuated seasonally, and the most obvious was HYM and HTY agroforestry, their Cv value between winter and summer exceeded 21%.

Using multi-temporal Landsat images within the Python module for the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land model, we investigated the spatiotemporal performance patterns of the Kou Valley irrigation scheme (KVIS) during two consecutive cropping seasons. Four performance indicators (depleted fraction, relative evapotranspiration, uniformity of water consumption, and crop water productivity) for rice, maize, and sweet potato were calculated and compared against standard values. Overall, the performance of the KVIS varied depending on year, crop, and the crop’s geographical position in the irrigation scheme. A gradient of spatially varied relative evapotranspiration was observed across the scheme, with the uniformity of water consumption being fair to good. Although rice was the most cultivated, a shift to more sweet potato farming could be adopted to benefit more from irrigation, given the relatively good performance achieved by this crop.

Their structural, physical, surface and colorimetric properties were analyzed, mainly as a function of BNC concentration. The aim of the research was to relate the changes in the intermolecular interactions between the components of the films (starch, anthocyanins and BNC) to the physical, surface and colorimetric properties that are important for the primary intended application of the produced films as pH indicators in smart packaging. The results showed that maize starch (MS) was more suitable as a matrix for the stabilization of anthocyanins compared to potato starch (PS). PS-based films showed a lower value of water contact angle than MS-based films, indicating stronger hydrophilicity. The swelling behavior results indicate that the concentrations of BNC in MS-based films (cca 10%) and the concentration of about 50% BNC in PS-based films are required if satisfactory properties of the indicator in terms of stability in a wet environment are to be achieved. The surface free energy results of PS-based films with BNC were between 62 and 68 mJ/m2 and with BNC and RCA between 64 and 68 mJ/m2; for MS-based films, the value was about 65 mJ/m2 for all samples with BNC and about 68 mJ/m2 for all samples with BNC and RCA. The visual color changes after immersion in different buffer solutions (pH 2.0–10.5) showed a gradual transition from red/pink to purple, blue and green for the observed samples. Films immersed in different buffers showed lower values of 2 to 10 lightness points (CIE L*) for PS-based films and 10 to 30 lightness points for MS-based films after the addition of BNC.

They hydrolyse starch molecules into polymers composing glucose units. Amylases have potential applications in a number of industrial processes including foods and pharmaceutical industries. Alkaline α-amylase has the potential of hydrolysing starch under alkaline pH and is useful in the starch and textile industries and as an ingredient of detergents. Amylases are produced from plants, however, microbial production processes have dominated applications in the industries. Optimization of microbial production processes can result in improved enzyme yields. METHODS Amylase activity was assayed by incubating the enzyme solution (0.5 ml) with 1% soluble starch (0.5 ml) in 0.1 M Tris/HCl buffer (pH 8.5). After 30 minutes, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 4 mL of 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS) reagent then heated for 10 min in boiling water bath and cooled in a refrigerator. Absorbance readings were used to estimate the units of enzyme activity from glucose standard curve. Hydrolysed native starches from cassava, rice, corn, coco yam, maize and potato and soluble starch were adjusted to pH 8.5 prior to incubation with crude enzyme solution. Reducing sugars produced were therefore determined. The effect of pH on enzyme activity of the alkaline α-amylase was determined by using buffer solutions of different pH (potassium phosphate buffer, 6.0-7.0; Tris-HCl buffer 7.5 to 9.0 and carbonate/bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.5-11) for enzyme assay. The pH stability profile of the enzyme was determined by incubating 0.5 ml of α-amylase enzyme in 0.1 M Tris/HCl buffer (pH 8.5) and 0.5 ml of 1% (w/v) soluble starch (Merck) in 0.1 M Tris/HCl buffer (pH 8.5) for 3 h in various buffers. The effect of temperature on enzyme activity was studied by incubating 0.5 mL of the enzyme solution contained in the test tube and 0.5 mL of 1% soluble starch (Merck) solution prepared in 0.1 M Tris/HCl buffer (pH 8.5) for 3 h at various temperatures (25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55 and 60°C) in a thermo static water bath. The reactions were stopped by adding DNS reagent. The enzyme activity was therefore determined. Thermal stability was studied by incubating 0.5 ml of enzyme solution in 0.1 M Tris/HCl buffer (pH 8.5) and 0.5 ml of 1% (w/v) soluble starch (Merck) in 0.1 M Tris/HCl buffer (pH 8.5) for 3 h at various temperatures (20, 30, 40, 50, 60 and 70°C) for 60 min. RESULTS The enzyme displayed optimal activity at pH 8.0 at which it produced maximum specific activity of 34.3 units/mg protein. Maximum stability was at pH 8.0 to 9.0. Maximum activity was observed at temperature of 50°C while thermo stability of the enzyme was observed at 40-50°C. The enzyme displayed a wide range of activities on starch and caused the release of 5.86, 4.75, 5.98, 3.44, 3.96, 8.84 mg/mL reducing sugar from cassava, potato, cocoyam, corn, rice and soluble starch respectively. CONCLUSIONS This investigation reports some biochemical characterization of alkaline α-amylase from Bacillus subtilis CB-18. The substrate specificities of this enzyme on various starches suggested that the alkaline α-amylase enzyme had combined activities on raw and soluble starch.",https://www.food.actapol.net/volume14/issue1/8_1_2015.pdf,

It was recommended by RAB Board of Directors. The methodology used encompasses the study area, sampling procedures, data collection and analysis tools. The main data collection tool used was FGD which targeted site agronomists and household head farmers producing rice, fruits and vegetables as high value crops in the scheme area. Through pair wise ranking technique most profitable cash crops in the scheme were ranked as follows: (1) tree tomato, (2) maracuja, (3) egg plants, (4) water melon, (5) tomato, (6) irish potatoes, (7) french beans, (8) onions, (9) carrots, (10) cabbages, (11) beetroots. From this point of views, findings from the study show only two most profitable crops: maracuja with 696 Frw/kg followed by tree tomato with Frw 249 Frw/kg. The third ranked cash crop being Irish potato (with a loss of -40 Frw/kg), the fourth is egg plant with a loss of- 177 Frw. The existing paddy rice production has shown a loss of – 270 Frw inspite the water availability all the year-round. Maize and bush bean show respectively losses of -543 Frw/kg and -1743 Frw. Hence it is understandable why farmers in the scheme area have already abandoned maize and beans cultivation. Findings show also water fees (20,000 Frw/season) determined based on maintenance costs and farmers income. For capacity building model, more than one thousand beneficiary farmers in Ngoma 22 Irrigation Scheme need strong farmer organisation for ownership of the scheme and increased profitability. To that effect, they need continued capacity building as stated in the tripartite IMTA: administrative and financial management, record keeping, and conflicts resolution management, integrated water management, operation and maintenance of irrigation infrastructures, best agricultural practices for sustainable farmers’ organisations and commercial farming. Key recommendations include fixing minimum prices for agricultural products in relation to costs of production- or setting subsidy prices, increase yield for each crop by meeting all requirements: lime, fertilisers and improvement of irrigation technologies in order to reach automatically increased yield. Farmers should continue to leave out traditional crops and adopt profitable cash crops identified in this study (e.g maracuja and tree tomato). They should also increase the ownership spirit through IWUA and cooperatives performance. They should adopt collective marketing of their products and pay water fees per season.",https://doi.org/10.38124/ijisrt/ijisrt24sep1536,

However, the structure mechanism in canopy is still unclear. We conducted a two-year field experiment on runoff plots, exploring whether the interaction between vegetation layers reduce soil erosion in maize and potato intercropping systems. The maize, potato, and weed layers in the intercropping system were removed by a single layer, two layers and three layers, respectively (total of 8 treatments including all layers removed as the control). Then, throughfall, runoff and sediment were measured at the plot and row scale on a weekly basis. Based on the difference between each treatment and the control, we calculated and found a relative reduction of runoff and sediment by any combination of the two vegetation layers greater than the sum of each single layer. In 2016 and 2017, the highest relative reduction of runoff reached 15.65% and 46.73%, respectively. Sediment loss decreased by 33.96% and 42.77%, respectively. Moreover, runoff and sediment reduced by the combination of all vegetation layers (no layers removed) was also larger than the sum of that by each single layer. In 2016 and 2017, the highest relative reduction of runoff reached 7.32% and 3.48%, respectively. So, there were synergistic effects among multi-level (two or three layers) vegetation layers in terms of decreasing soil erosion on sloping land. Maize redistributes more throughfall at the maize intra-specific row and the maize and potato inter-specific, which is favorable for the synergistic effect of reducing soil erosion. This finding shows an important mechanism of maize and potato intercropping for soil and water conservation, and may promote the application of diverse cropping systems for sustainable agriculture in mountainous areas.",https://wlv.openrepository.com/bitstream/2436/623476/3/Zhang_et_al_Synergistic_effects_2020.pdf,

Therefore engineering C4 feature into C3 plants has been suggested as a feasible way to increase photosynthesis and yield of C3 plants, such as rice, wheat, and potato. To identify the possible transition from C3 to C4 plants, the systematic comparison of C3 and C4 metabolism is necessary.ResultsWe compared C3 and C4 metabolic networks using the improved constraint-based models for Arabidopsis and maize. By graph theory, we found the C3 network exhibit more dense topology structure than C4. The simulation of enzyme knockouts demonstrated that both C3 and C4 networks are very robust, especially when optimizing CO2 fixation. Moreover, C4 plant has better robustness no matter the objective function is biomass synthesis or CO2 fixation. In addition, all the essential reactions in C3 network are also essential for C4, while there are some other reactions specifically essential for C4, which validated that the basic metabolism of C4 plant is similar to C3, but C4 is more complex. We also identified more correlated reaction sets in C4, and demonstrated C4 plants have better modularity with complex mechanism coordinates the reactions and pathways than that of C3 plants. We also found the increase of both biomass production and CO2 fixation with light intensity and CO2 concentration in C4 is faster than that in C3, which reflected more efficient use of light and CO2 in C4 plant. Finally, we explored the contribution of different C4 subtypes to biomass production by setting specific constraints.ConclusionsAll results are consistent with the actual situation, which indicate that Flux Balance Analysis is a powerful method to study plant metabolism at systems level. We demonstrated that in contrast to C3, C4 plants have less dense topology, higher robustness, better modularity, and higher CO2 and radiation use efficiency. In addition, preliminary analysis indicated that the rate of CO2 fixation and biomass production in PCK subtype are superior to NADP-ME and NAD-ME subtypes under enough supply of water and nitrogen.",https://bmcsystbiol.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/1752-0509-6-S2-S9,

Most farmers rely on traditional, small-scale subsistence farming with low fertilizer use and low-yield seeds. Similarly, less than 3% of the total cultivated area employs any form of irrigation, mostly non-pressurized. Meanwhile, electricity providers frequently struggle with low and unpredictable demand, challenging their ability to recover rural infrastructure investments. Using electricity to pump irrigation water can increase agricultural productivity and improve the financial sustainability of rural electricity supply. This study evaluates the productive and economic feasibility of pressurized small-scale irrigation systems in Ethiopia, Rwanda, and Uganda for three staple crops and two horticulture crops. To study these effects, we develop simplified engineering-based irrigation and hydrology models and combine them with an existing biophysical crop growth model using district-level agrometeorological, soil, and crop physiology data as inputs. Our results indicate that small-scale pressurized irrigation can significantly increase yields for horticulture crops and staples such as maize or potato grown with improved seeds and moderate or greater fertility levels. The sensitivity analysis shows that irrigation may be techno-economically viable in up to 36% of Ethiopian woredas, 67% of Rwandan districts, and 45% of Ugandan districts provided the use of improved cultivars and non-limiting fertility conditions.

All of them are exposed to a natural environmental contamination and to the impact of the copper mining activity throughout the region. Thallium concentration in plants exhibits species-dependent preferences. Thus, the enrichment of Tl in the edible parts of crop species decreases in the following order: potato > broad bean > maize grain.

Longer and more intense heatwaves and droughts are expected. The Gordes Dam in Turkey provides drinking water for Izmir city and irrigation water for a wide range of crops grown in the basin. Using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), this study examined the effects of projected climate change (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5) on the simulated streamflow, nitrogen loads, and crop yields in the basin for the period of 2031–2060. A hierarchical approach to define the hydrological response units (HRUs) of SWAT and the Fast Automatic Calibration Tool (FACT) were used to reduce computational time and improve model performance. The simulations showed that the average annual discharge into the reservoir is projected to increase by between 0.7 m3/s and 4 m3/s under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 climate change scenarios. The steep slopes and changes in precipitation in the study area may lead to higher simulated streamflow. In addition, the rising temperatures predicted in the projections could lead to earlier spring snowmelt. This could also lead to increased streamflow. Projected nitrogen loads increased by between 8.8 and 25.1 t/year. The results for agricultural production were more variable. While the yields of poppy, tobacco, winter barley, and winter wheat will increase to some extent because of climate change, the yields of maize, cucumbers, and potatoes are all predicted to be negatively affected. Non-continuous and limited data on water quality and crop yields lead to uncertainties, so that the accuracy of the model is affected by these limitations and inconsistencies. However, the results of this study provide a basis for developing sustainable water and land management practices at the catchment scale in response to climate change. The changes in water quality and quantity and the ecological balance resulting from changes in land use and management patterns for economic benefit could not be fully demonstrated in this study.

In this work, we sequence the complete genome of Dickeya aquatica type strain, a species isolated from water that was first assumed to be non-phytopathogenic. We show that the proteome of D. aquatica contains a wide number of proteins involved in Dickeya virulence, including plant cell wall degrading enzymes, suggesting that this species could be in fact pathogenic. Using experimental approaches, we confirm this prediction and uncover the particular affinity of D. aquatica for acidic fruits. In-depth phylogenomic analyses reveal that Dickeya species display a great degree of genetic plasticity in the pathogenicity determinants, explaining how this bacterial group was able to colonize a wide variety of plants growing in different climates. These observations greatly advance our understanding of how bacteria adapt to new ecological niches. Summary Dickeya is a genus of phytopathogenic enterobacterales causing soft rot in a variety of plants (e.g. potato, chicory, maize). Among the species affiliated to this genus, Dickeya aquatica, described in 2014, remained particularly mysterious because it had no known host. Furthermore, while D. aquatica was proposed to represent a deep-branching species among Dickeya genus, its precise phylogenetic position remained elusive. Here, we report the complete genome sequence of the D. aquatica type strain 174/2. We demonstrate the affinity of D. aquaticaT for acidic fruits such as tomato and cucumber, and show that exposure of this bacterium to acidic pH induces twitching motility. An in-depth phylogenomic analysis of all available Dickeya proteomes pinpoints D. aquatica as the second deepest branching lineage within this genus and reclassifies two lineages that likely correspond to new genomospecies (gs.): Dickeya gs. poaceaephila (Dickeya sp NCPPB 569) and Dickeya gs. undicola (Dickeya sp 2B12), together with a new putative genus, tentatively named Prodigiosinella. Finally, from comparative analyses of Dickeya proteomes we infer the complex evolutionary history of this genus, paving the way to study the adaptive patterns and processes of Dickeya to different environmental niches and hosts. In particular, we hypothetize that the lack of xylanases and xylose degradation pathways in D. aquatica could reflects adaptation to aquatic charophyte hosts which, in contrast to land plants, do not contain xyloglucans.",https://doi.org/10.1101/568105,

However, higher value to the extent of 2.44 mg kg -1 has also been reported by Wang Lixia (1979). The Cd concentration also increased with time. Mean Cd concentrations in soil increased form 1.13 mg kg -1 in 1979 to 1.94 mg kg -1 in 1987. Cadmium in agricultural soil is likewise relatively immobile under normal conditions, but could become more mobile under certain conditions such as increased soil acidity and its cadmium level may be enhanced by the usage of phosphate fertilizers manure or sewage sludge (Table 1). Nickel concentration in soil Contributions of nickel to soil arise from both natural and man-made sources. Among the farmer are parent bedrocks deposits enriched in nickel, micrometeorites and cosmic dust. The last two are of relatively little importance. Man-made source of nickel include smelting of nickel ferrous areas, metal refining, burning of coal, burning of petroleum products, disposal of waste sewage and sludge and fertilizer applications. The effects of manmade sources on the nickel contents of soil in generally local, although in certain cases industrial and other man made plumes of pollution combined with unusual climate condition may, disperse nickel over large regions of the earth. International Journal of Current Microbiology and Applied Sciences ISSN: 2319-7706 Volume 7 Number 10 (2018) Journal homepage: http://www.ijcmas.com Heavy metals like cadmium, nickel, lead, chromium, mercury etc are important environmental pollutants in areas with anthropogenic pressure. Their presence in the atmosphere, soil and water, even in traces can cause serious problems to all organisms. Heavy metal accumulation in soils is of great concern in agricultural production due to the adverse effects on food quality, crop growth (Ma et al., 1994) and environmental health. Heavy metal bioaccumulation in the food chain can be especially highly dangerous to human health.

Swaine (1955) given a wide range from 5 to 500 mg kg -1 Ni, our estimate of the average nickel content of soil calculated from a large number of analyses done in the Geological survey of Canada and those in the available world literature is 35 mg kg 1 . According to Page (1974), heavy metal constitutes only 0.1% of the sludge solids but, its content in soil may be significantly raised through long term land application of sludge Mahdy et al., (2007) reported that application of biosolids increases DTPA-extractable nickel. The levels of extractable Ni reach to 25.12 mg kg -1 in clay soil at the highest application rate where as in sandy soil the levels of extractable Ni was 17.18 mg kg -1 , while in calcareous soil it reached to 22.08 mg kg -1 at the highest application rate. Cadmium concentration and uptake in different vegetables Cadmium is taken up from soil by the plant roots. The plants grown on soils that are very sandy, acidic and are low in organic matter more easily absorb cadmium in soil attaches to clay particles & sandy soils with low clay content and organic matter induces higher uptake of cadmium. Lagarwerff (1971) studied Cd, Pb, and Zn uptake by radish grown on soil near a busy highway and observed a decrease in yield and metal content with increasing pH. An increase in Cd uptake by eight food crops due to the application of CdCl2 has been reported by John (1973). The result was supported by Jone et al., (1973) who showed that Cd either in salt form or sludge borne was readily available to soybean but never observed seed. Cd levels more than 1 mg kg 1 with addition of 87.1 mt ha -1 of digested sludge containing 129 mg kg -1 Cd. Satyaprakash (1992) reported that all crop species accumulated higher amount of Cd in their roots. Considering the average value, the Cd accumulation in different crop species was found in the order: Potato> Toria> Cauliflower> Faba bean> Cabbage> Amaranthus. Guttormsen et al., (1995) were conducted field trails over three year period with Chinese cabbage and carrots grown in a sandy soil. The NPK fertilizers containing 1, 30, 90 and 400 mg Cd kg -1 P were applied at the rate of 0.07, 2.1, 6.3 and 28 g Cd ha -1 yr -1 . The amounts of Cd added through phosphate rock also ranged between 0.1 and 28 g ha -1 yr -1 . The increased Cd application rates through NPK fertilizers increased the Cd concentration in both vegetables. The Cd uptake by both crops was significantly higher. Chinese cabbage exhibited lower Cd concentration than carrots. Carrot leaves contained higher Cd than its roots. Cadmium removals by Chinese cabbage and carrot were about 0.7 and 1.3 g ha -1 yr -1 , respectively. At pH 5.5, Cd concentrations in the two crops, based on a three year average, were 23 and 46% higher than at pH 6.5. Cadmium uptake by Chinese cabbage from different sources of phosphate rock was affected to a very limited extent. Cadmium concentration generally increased over the years. Cadmium concentration in shoots and roots varied both with different cadmium levels and type of vegetables. Generally cadmium accumulations in various plant parts in vegetables crops increased with the increasing cadmium concentration in the growth medium. Root cadmium increased more sharply than shoot cadmium. Celery contained higher Cd in the edible parts than other vegetable species (Ni et al., 2002). The cadmium concentration in each of the three parts varied with the level of cadmium and highest being in treatment receiving 100 mg kg -1 Cd. In this treatment, the level of cadmium accumulation in the stem, leaf and root was 3.36, 2.60 and 1.78 mg kg -1 dry weight, respectively. The results also show that Cd accumulation was the least in the root and most in the stem of all species (Table 2 and 3). Int.J.Curr.Microbiol.App.Sci (2018) 7(10): 2341-2352 2343 Nickel concentration and uptake in different vegetables Banin et al., (1981) reported higher content of Ni in plant with sewage water application than irrigation water and explained that the uptake of a given element appeared to be largely determined by its solubility in the soil solution and can be generally predicted by its ionic strength. Sailed and Kardos (1977) suggested that crop tolerance to Ni application varied with plant species and metal species. The Ni content of most species of vegetables usually didn’t exceed 10μg g -1 except for taxa growing on nickel rich soils where 10-100 μg g -1 Ni level was common. Use of Ni up to 125 mg kg -1 increased Ni content in alfalfa but did not exert pronounced influence on yield depression. 250 mg kg -1 ppm Ni treatment significantly increased Ni content and depressive effect on alfalfa yields (Taylor and Allinson, 1981). The Ni content in alfalfa varied from 0.5 to 9.4 mg kg -1 however, 300 mg kg -1 Ni in plants was recorded with the addition of 200 mg kg -1 Ni in soil. The linear relationship between Ni uptake by plants and the amount of applied Ni was reported (Valdares et. al., 1983). The maximum concentration of metal was found in spinach leaves followed by berseem, cauliflower and maize leaves, while the cauliflower heads had the lowest concentration (Kansal and Singh, 1983). The highest Ni contents was found in roots. Plant grown in pots absorbed more Ni than from the same soils in the field. The uptake of Ni in the shoots of all the crops increased significantly with increasing levels of Ni application. The nickel uptake in spinach increased from 19.4  g pot in control to 37.0.2  g pot with 80 mg kg soil but at higher levels of Ni application, there was decrease in Ni uptake. Similarly Ni uptake in fenugreek and coriander increased upto 60 and 120 mg kg -1 soil application and showed decreasing trend there after (AR MNS, Ludhiana 2004-05). Kumar (2005) reported that the Ni-concentration in different vegetable crops depended on the distance of the cropped site with respect to discharge point of sewage-sludge. Higher Ni concentration in different crop species grown on sewage irrigated soils were obtained as compared to those grown on the ground water irrigated soils. Different plant species varied in their Ni concentration in the sequence; Potato> Toria> Cauliflower> Amaranthus> Cabbage. The Nickel uptake by corn plants was significantly increased at all application rates in all soil studies and the corn plants grown in the clay soil had a higher assimilative capacity for uptake of Ni than other soils. The uptake values of heavy metals followed the following order; clay > calcareous > sandy soils. The Ni concentrations in all plant parts were higher in the biosolids treatment than in the control for all soils. Nickel concentration accumulated in parts of corn plants in the following order: roots> shoots. In general, application of biosolids significantly increased Ni concentration in shoots and roots of corn plants grown in all studies soils. The increase in Ni concentration peaked at the high level of biosolids application rate (3%) (Mahdy et al., 2007) (Table 4–7). Response of cadmium application Bingham et al., (1976) reported that soybean is most Sensitive crop where 25% reduction in yield by the soil application of as low as 5 to 15 ppm Cd. An increase in Cd content in soybean seed has also been reported by Ham and Dowdy (1978) due to sludge application. They observed that Cd addition through inorganic salt did not affect soybean yield but increased its concentration in soybean seed. Addition of cadmium to the soil lowered the dry matter yield of ryegrass and also reduced the yield of oat grain as reported by Allison and Dzialo (1980).

Flour from these roots and tubers and cereals are relatively cheaper, easy to produce and can be used in the manufacturing of wide range of products, including bread, cookies, meat pies, cake, chips and doughnut. However, due to the processing techniques used these flours may be contaminated with trace metals and aflatoxins. It was therefore necessary to determine the concentration of trace metal: As, Cu, Fe, Hg, Pb, Zn, and aflatoxin B1, B2, G1, and G2 in maize, sorghum, millet, rice, cocoyam, water yam and sweet potato flour samples used as composite flour for making bread and other pastries.ResultsThe trace metal concentration of essential metals: Cu, Fe and Zn in all the seven flour samples analyzed ranged from 0.03 ± 0.01 to 6.63 ± 0.02, 10.97 ± 0.01 to 201.40 ± 0.14, and 6.04 ± 0.03 to 34.36 ± 0.06 mg/Kg, respectively.

Aflatoxin B1, B2, G1, and G2 were not detected in any of the samples.ConclusionThe concentrations of As, Cu, Hg, Pb and Zn determined in all seven flour samples were below the WHO set limits and therefore pose no health threat whiles Fe concentration in some flour samples was above the WHO set limit. Aflatoxin B1, B2, G1, and G2 were not detected in all flour samples and hence pose no health threat.",https://foodcontaminationjournal.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s40550-016-0038-2,

The autotetraploidy of the modern commercial potato makes breeding of new resistant and high-yielding cultivars challenging due to complicated and time-consuming identification and selection processes of desired crop features. On the other hand, plant protection of existing cultivars using conventional synthetic pesticides is increasingly restricted due to safety issues for both consumers and the environment. Chitosan is known to display antimicrobial activity against a broad range of plant pathogens and shows the ability to trigger resistance in plants by elicitation of defense responses. As chitosan is a renewable, biodegradable and nontoxic compound, it is considered as a promising next-generation plant-protecting agent. However, the molecular and cellular modes of action of chitosan treatment are not yet understood. In this study, transcriptional changes in chitosan-treated potato leaves were investigated via RNA sequencing. Leaves treated with a well-defined chitosan polymer at low concentration were harvested 2 and 5 h after treatment and their expression profile was compared against water-treated control plants. We observed 32 differentially expressed genes (fold change ≥ 1; p-value ≤ 0.05) 2 h after treatment and 83 differentially expressed genes 5 h after treatment. Enrichment analysis mainly revealed gene modulation associated with electron transfer chains in chloroplasts and mitochondria, accompanied by the upregulation of only a very limited number of genes directly related to defense. As chitosan positively influences plant growth, yield, and resistance, we conclude that activation of electron transfer might result in the crosstalk of different organelles via redox signals to activate immune responses in preparation for pathogen attack, concomitantly resulting in a generally improved metabolic state, fostering plant growth and development. This conclusion is supported by the rapid and transient production of reactive oxygen species in a typical oxidative burst in the potato leaves upon chitosan treatment. This study furthers our knowledge on the mode of action of chitosan as a plant-protecting agent, as a prerequisite for improving its ability to replace or reduce the use of less environmentally friendly agro-chemicals.",https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2020.01193/pdf,

The two species are univoltine in most of their range. They also have similar life cycles and morphology. However, southern mole cricket is primarily carnivorous, whereas tawny mole cricket is herbivorous (Taylor 1979, Ulagaraj 1975, Matheny 1981). The African mole cricket, Gryllotalpa africana Palisot de Beauvois, is a world-wide pest (Sithole 1986). It damages plants including wheat, maize, rice, sorghum, millet, barley, oats, potatoes, cassava, groundnuts, strawberries, turnips, tobacco, and vegetables in Africa, Asia, and Europe. It also causes severe damage to turfgrass on golf courses in South Africa and Asia (Brandenburg, unpubl. data). Tsedeke (1979) reported that surface tunneling behavior, which is partly determined by feeding preference, is different between the two species in the U.S. We therefore speculate that tunnel architectures of three species are also different judging from the differences in their feeding behavior and damage. This study used fiberglass resins to compare tunnel architecture of three species of mole crickets in two locations Tawny and southern mole cricket tunnel castings were made on the driving range of Oyster Bay Golf Course, Brunswick County, NC, during 1998 to 2000. The turfgrass on the driving range was hybrid bermudagrass, Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers. in sandy loam soil. African mole cricket tunnel castings were made in typical heavy clay soil at Silver Lakes Golf and Country Club, Pretoria, South Africa. The turfgrass on the fairway was Kikuyu grass, Pennisetum clandestinum Hochst. ex Chiov. We located mole cricket tunnel entrances by hand, and cleaned foreign matter, debris, and soil from the area around the entrance. We then used a soapy water flush (Short & Koehler 1979) as an irritant to flush the mole cricket from the tunnel for species identification. The soapy water flushing also helped to find other entrances to the tunnel and make the soil around the entrance firm. Areas without turf were avoided because the tunnels are often blocked by loose soil during the flushing. We have previously reported that fiberglass resin is the best material for mole cricket tunnel casting (Brandenburg et al. 2001). Bondo? fiberglass resin and hardener (Dynatron/Bondo Corp., Atlanta, GA), was used in the U.S. study and a similar product used in South Africa. This and other similar products are widely available at local hardware and automobile repair stores. Approximately 2/3 of the recommended amount of hardener was added to the fiberglass resin (about 1 ml hardener/100 ml resin). The fiberglass resin hardens quickly after adding hardener, therefore, the whole procedure must be done quickly. The fiberglass resin container was covered and shaken after adding hardener. The contents were then poured immediately into the tunnel entrance in a steady stream. The excavation of the castings started 1-2 h after pouring. The fiberglass resin in one can (1 1) usually filled two to three mole cricket tunnels. We used a large screwdriver to clear away the grass roots surrounding the tunnel entrance and to determine the direction of the casting before starting to dig the cast. Finding other entrance(s) of the tunnel helps to judge direction the tunnel casting. There are at least two entrances for tawny and African mole cricket tunnels. The soil on tunnel casts was washed away with water following excavation. We made over 100 castings and excavations during 3 years. Tunnels of tawny mole crickets were almost always (90%) in the shape of 'Y' with two entrances for each tunnel (Fig. IA, B, C). Variations were occasionally observed in the tunnel architecture. There might be two parallel 'Y's linking together to form a tunnel, or, two entrances observed at each end of a tunnel. The length of most tawny mole cricket tunnels ranged from 50 to 70 cm. Tunnels of African mole crickets also typically showed ""Y"" shape (Fig. 1G, H, I). The length of African mole cricket tunnels ranged from 10 cm to 23 cm. This was much shorter than that observed in tawny mole crickets. The tunnels of southern mole crickets were more likely in a reversed 'Y"" shape with only one surface entrance (Fig. 1D, E, F). The tunnels often branched within 10 cm deep of the soil surface. The tunnels were usually much shorter than those of tawny mole cricket. The difference in tunnel architecture probably relates to the behavioral difference of the three species. Southern mole crickets are carnivorous. They seek prey throughout the soil. Our observations and research by Tsedeke (1979) suggested that southern mole crickets were much more active in tunneling than tawny and African mole crickets. This may be why southern mole cricket tunnels were almost always branched down into the soil rather than near the soil surface.

Bioenergy production and consumption can help sustain smallholders’ energy needs and generate employment and income, but it also raises concerns over social justice and equity, especially where crops used for bioenergy could also be used for food. This perspective paper is grounded in a literature review related to three different crops in Brazil: sugarcane, landrace maize and sweet potato. It seeks to determine if these crops offer the potential to support smallholder farmers’ development in a more equitable way, focusing on opportunities for their use in bioenergy. We review the literature to identify policies shaping the smallholder development context in relation to these crops, assessing whose knowledge informs policy and institutional decision making, and highlighting the policy attention afforded to the different crops from different sectors. We further evaluate the literature on each crop in relation to water use and calorific value (i.e., food and energy). Our review indicates that while sugarcane has received the most policy and institutional attention, its development is largely anchored in research and development investments that support large-scale commercial farms and agri-businesses. Smallholders have not benefited or had the opportunity to engage in relevant policy decision making for sugarcane cultivation. At the same time, smallholders hold valuable untapped knowledge on the cultivation of sweet potato and landrace maize, both of which have the potential to generate development opportunities for smallholders. Our review suggests that the environmental impact of landrace maize and sweet potato in terms of water use is significantly lower than sugarcane, while they can generate more calories for energy or food consumption and offer diversification opportunities. Despite that these alternative crops offer considerable untapped potential to support rural development, more research is still needed to harness these benefits. Changes are needed to address inequities in policies, institutions and the types of knowledge informing decision making. Such changes need to afford smallholder farmers greater recognition and participation in decision making, so that the distribution of benefits from the three study crops can reach them to support their development better.",https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/12/5/2146/pdf?version=1583914704,

To ensure continuous food production throughout the year, increasing irrigation is inevitable. However, the water available for agricultural use is inadequate due to the limited water resources globally and climate change challenges threatening water availability. The economy of Mbale, Uganda, mainly depends on rainfed agriculture. The rain season is from April to October whilst the dry season is from November to March. Therefore, this study examines the potential of rainwater harvesting for domestic and agricultural uses in Mbale. The AquaCrop model was adopted for the yield response of crops to water during the dry season. The study reveals that comparing the resulting rainwater harvesting potential with the water consumption, up to 186% of the annual water demand for domestic use, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) standard, can be provided. Thus, the excess harvested water from a 200 m rooftop was simulated for irrigation purposes, which shows that it can be used to cultivate areas of 269, 429, 125 and 388 m for cabbage, tomato, maize and potato respectively during dry periods. The economic analysis shows a benefit cost ratio of 1.99 over 10 years. It concludes by recommending RWH as an alternative water supply source for domestic and agricultural uses.",https://iwaponline.com/wpt/article-pdf/15/2/295/763546/wpt0150295.pdf,

In the Tigray region of Ethiopia, where water is scarce and a determinant resource, no regional-level validation of on-farm irrigation scheduling had been conducted until now. The objectives of this study were to (i) validate farmers’ irrigation scheduling practices and (ii) optimize water consumption for increased irrigated area and number of farmers. Eight different irrigation schemes were purposively selected from the Tigray region. Primary data, acquired through field measurements, observations, and discussions, were supplemented with secondary data. Farmers' irrigation scheduling practices were predominantly of the ""Fixed"" type, characterized by constant irrigation intervals and amounts. Unfortunately, these practices were non-optimal, with 55% over-irrigation and 45% under-irrigation. Over-irrigation instances ranged from 1350 m3in a garlic plot within the Mesima scheme to a maximum of 1,327,067 m3in a maize plot within the Serenta scheme. The excess water could potentially be utilized to irrigate an additional area of 2 to 148 hectares, thereby benefiting 7 to 296 more farmers, respectively. Conversely, instances of under-irrigation in the Fre Lekatit scheme resulted in yield reductions of 10,445 kg for potatoes and 138,499 kg for maize. In the Tigray region, most of the schemes are semi-arid, emphasizing the imperative need for water conservation. Renovating regional-level irrigation scheduling by integrating performance assessment and enhancing water productivity at the field level, and establishing a remote-sensing-based 'Real-Time Irrigation Scheduling System' is deemed necessary to sustain dryland irrigated agriculture.",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s44279-024-00021-6.pdf,

Calibrated model runs were conducted for wheat, barley, grain maize, oilseed rape, potato and sugar beet. The WF of cereals could be up to 20 times larger than the WF of tuber and root crops; the largest share was attributed to the green WF. The green and blue WF compared favourably with global benchmark values (R2 = 0.64–0.80; d = 0.91–0.95). The variability in the WF of arable crops across different regions in Europe is mainly due to variability in crop yield ( c v ¯ = 45%) and to a lesser extent to variability in crop water use ( c v ¯ = 21%). The WF variability between countries ( c v ¯ = 14%) is lower than the variability between seasons ( c v ¯ = 22%) and between crops ( c v ¯ = 46%).

It is imperative to develop alternative crop rotations beyond the simplified conventional winter wheat–summer maize (W–M) rotation for alleviating the groundwater over-extraction in China’s Huang-Huai Plain. This study systematically quantified crop water requirement (ETc) and irrigation water requirement (ETaw) of eight crops from 2013 to 2018 based on the SIMETAW model applied to the Shangqiu area in the Huang-Huai Plain. Fourteen crop rotations (CI (i.e., crop harvests per rotation cycle year) 1.5 or 2) were constructed based on the ROTAT model. Results showed that compared to W–M rotation, the alternative rotations (CI = 1.5) significantly reduced the annual ETc in wet, normal, and dry years by 9–21%. Replacing winter wheat in the double cropping system did not significantly decrease annual ETc. Wheat–soybean rotation had similar annual ETc and ETaw accompanied by higher economic output and equivalent yield about 1.2 times, with 9% more protein output than the W–M rotation. There were eight crop rotations having greater comprehensive evaluation index (CEI) than W–M rotation by Entropy-TOPSIS when considering 10 indicators including water requirements, yield, economic benefits, water use efficiency, energy, and nutritional values. Spring potato–summer soybean had the highest CEI of 0.627. Sweet potato and potato showed advantages when included in rotations by increasing yield. “Wheat–soybean”-based rotations (CI = 1.5) also performed well in profitability and protein output. Replacing summer maize with soybean is promising for profitability and nutrition output without increasing irrigation requirements. Therefore, decreasing the cropping index, or involving soybean or sweet potato in rotations can be a useful way to improve sustainable land use, save water, and ensure food products in this water stressed region.",https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/15/13/10229/pdf?version=1687931561,

The impact of intercropping maize (Zea mays L.) with potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) on yield, land equivalent ratios (LER), water equivalent ratio (WER), water use, energy output, and net economic return were examined under seven planting systems: potato grown solely or intercropped on the flat field without mulching, maize grown solely or intercropped with potato on ridges or flat field with or without plastic film mulched. The three intercropping systems had 3–13% less water use than the monocropping. Among the intercropped systems, flat field caused more depletion of soil water than ridged field for both years. Compared to monocultures, intercropping with plastic film mulching and ridging significantly increased LER and WER. Meanwhile, intercropping with mulching and ridging significantly increased net economic return and energy output by 8% and 24%, respectively, when compared to monocropping. These results suggest that maize under plastic film mulched ridge-furrow plot intercropped with potato under flat plot without mulching increased energy output, net economic return, and water use efficiency without increasing soil water depletion, which could be an optimal intercropping system for the semiarid farmland on the western Loess Plateau.",https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0472/11/11/1100/pdf?version=1636613098,
