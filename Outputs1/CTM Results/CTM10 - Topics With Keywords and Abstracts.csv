A literature review was done to appraise the agronomical research works on major field crops and cropping systems at IAAS, Rampur, Chitwan, Nepal. The objectives were to summarize the results of various agronomic research works at the institute to determine the extent and causes of yield gaps of major crops, and to identify the future research priorities. The review revealed that the on-station research at IAAS in the past were conducted on 14 crops, on maize-and wheat-based systems and on 5 major themes. The main themes of research in most crops were varietal evaluation and breeding, crop management, soil management, weed management and pest management though in some crops research was conducted on other themes too. A total of 81 studies were conducted on various crops, of which 48 were on cereals, 14 on legumes, 10 on oilseed crops, and 6 on potato. There were 2 studies on wheat-based and a single study on maize-based systems. Average potential yields of rice, maize and wheat were 5.5, 4.4 and 5.0 t/ha, while research station yields and farmers' field yields of these crops were 3.4, 3.3 and 3.5 t/ha and 2.7, 1.8 and 1.9 t/ha, respectively, in Chitwan. The yield gaps between the potential and farmers' field for those crops were 2.76, 2.58 and 3.15 t/ha, while those between potential and research station yields were 2.1, 1.1 and 1.53 t/ha, respectively. The gaps between research station and farmers' field yields were much smaller in rice (0.66 t/ha) than in maize (1.48 t/ha) and wheat (1.62 t/ha). The results suggest that there is a great scope to raise yields of all cereals in farmers’ fields, more so for wheat and maize than for rice. Improved agronomical research on rice varieties and crop and soil management required to reduce the yield gap for rice, while adoption of recommended technologies by farmers would help reduce yield gap in wheat. For soybean, lentil, and potato, the gap between potential and farmers’ yields is much larger than the other yield gaps suggesting large scope for increase in yields in farmers’ fields through both improved management and improved varieties. Innovative and new researches on eco-region suited variety identification, improved crop and soil management, improved water and N management and on agro-meteorology and crop modeling are suggested as priorities for future research to uplift the productivity and reduce yield gaps of major crops in Chitwan district of Nepal.

Sci. 26:1-20 (2005)","A field experiment was conducted during three seasons of 2019-20 at RPCAU, Pusa to evaluate the Effect of Diversification on System Productivity and Profitability under North Bihar Condition. Treatment comprised cropping systems in main plots: C1 - Rice - Wheat - Fallow, C2 - Rice - Wheat - Green Gram, C3 - Rice - Maize - Dhaincha, C4 - Rice - Maize + Potato - Dhaincha, C5 - Rice - Maize + Green Pea - Dhaincha and moisture regimes in sub plots with 3 days disappearance of ponded water in kharif season, three levels of IW/CPE ratio in rabi season I1: IW/CPE = 0.6, I2: IW/CPE = 0.8, I3: IW/CPE = 1.0 and one or two irrigation in zaid season if required. Maximum rice grain yield (5.36 t/ha) was observed at C5 cropping system which was significantly superior to C1 and at par with C2, C3 and C4 cropping system. Maximum Production Efficiency (92.13 kg/ha/day) and Profitability (1156.49 ₹/ha/day) was found at C4 cropping system which was significantly superior to   C1, C2, C3 and C5 Cropping system. In sub plots maximum Production Efficiency (56.72 kg/ha/day), and Profitability (685.88 ₹/ha/day) was found at I3 which was significantly superior to I2 and I1. Relative Production efficiency was found to be maximum in C4 (204.36 %) and I3 (13.58 %) cropping system.","A field experiment was conducted during three seasons of 2018-19 at RPCAU, Pusa to evaluate the Effect of Residue Management and Cropping Systems on direct seeded rice and System productivity. Treatments comprised cropping systems in main plots: C1 Rice Wheat Fallow, C2 Rice Wheat Green Gram, C3 Rice Maize Dhaincha, C4 Rice Maize + Potato Dhaincha, C5 Rice Maize + Green Pea Dhaincha and moisture regimes in sub plots with 3 days disappearance of ponded water in kharif season, three levels of IW/CPE ratio in rabi season I1 IW/CPE = 0.6, I2 IW/CPE = 0.8, I3 IW/CPE = 1.0. Maximum number of tillers (273.55/m ), dry matter production (1464.91g/m 2 ), number of panicles/m 2 (267.80 m 2 ), grain yield (52.21q/ha) of rice was observed in C5 cropping system and panicle length (23.99 cm cm), number of grains /panicle (160.05), straw yield (69.58 q/ha) in C4 which was significantly superior than C1 cropping system. Plant height and 1000 grain weight, harvest index and Land Use Efficiency (LUE) were non significantly affected by different cropping systems. Maximum Rice Economic Yield (REY) of 24.26 Original Research Article Kumari et al.; CJAST, 39(20): 132-137, 2020; Article no.CJAST.60069 133 t/ha and Production efficiency (PE) 73.97 kg/ha/day was observed in C4 which was significantly superior to rest of treatments. In sub plot maximum REY (15.905 t/ha) and PE (49.81 kg/ha/day) were observed in IW/CPE ratio 1 which was significantly superior to IW/CPE ratio 0.6 and 0.8.","To appraise the major research outputs of agronomic crops and cropping systems and to direct the future research priorities of Agronomy Department of post-graduate (PG) program of Institute of Agriculture and Animal Sciences (IAAS), a rigorous review was accomplished on about two decadal (2000-2018) student’s thesis research works. The review revealed that the agronomic researches at IAAS from 2000 to 2012 were concentrated mostly in on-station farm of Rampur, Chitwan and found their focus on 11 food grain crops with five major themes viz. varietal evaluation, crop management, soil nutrient and weeds management, and crop simulation modeling. With the shifting of IAAS PG program from Rampur to Kirtipur in 2013, the major agronomic researches were found to be concentrated in on-farm stations due to transitional movement of IAAS to Agriculture and Forestry University, Nepal. A total of 115 agronomic studies were conducted on various crops, of which 92 were on cereals, 8 on legumes, oilseed and minor cereals including potato. There were records of 10 studies on rice-wheat and 3 studies on maize-based systems. The huge gaps between the potential and farmers' field yield and between the potential and research station yields for rice, maize and wheat crops suggested a great scope to raise yields of cereals by improved agronomical researches on varieties evaluation, crop and nutrient management and weed management. Simulation modeling study predicted that the varieties of rice and maize adopted at present could sustain the yields only for recent few years and needed for introduction of new climate resilient varieties, then after. Innovative and new researches on eco-region suited on-farm trails with variety identification, improved crop husbandry and soil nutrient management, improved weed and water management and on agro-meteorology, conservation agriculture, climate change adaptation and crop simulation modeling are advised as future research frontiers to uplift the productivity and reduce yield gaps of major food crops and to strengthen the academics of post-graduate research in near future.","A two year field experiment was conducted at Research farm of Department of Agronomy, Punjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana during kharif 2016 and kharif 2017. The experiment was laid out in split-plot design with seven maize (Zea mays L.) based crop sequences, viz. maize-wheat, maize-potato-mentha + onion, maize + cowpea (f)- potato-mentha + onion, maize + cowpea (f)-potato-spring maize, maize + cowpea (f)-gobhi sarson-summer moong, maize-toria + gobhi sarson-summer moong and maize + cowpea (f)-toria + gobhi sarson-summer moong in main plots and four irrigation schedules of 0.75 IW/CPE, 1.0 IW/CPE, 1.25 IW/CPE and recommended schedule in sub plots replicated thrice. Intercropping of cowpea with maize increased the grain yield, crop and water productivity, energy output and net returns of kharif maize. The maximum grain yield of maize was recorded under recommended schedule which was statistically at par with 1.25 IW/CPE irrigation regime. Irrigation regime of 1.0 IW/CPE recorded the highest apparent water productivity with 3.00 and 3.07 kg/m3 during 2016 and 2017, respectively. Irrigation regimes of I1.25 and IRec were the most energy efficient and energy productive.","The winter wheat–summer maize double cropping system caused overexploitation of groundwater in the North China Plain; it is unsustainable and threatens food security and the overall wellbeing of humankind in the region. Finding water-saving cropping systems without compromising food security is a more likely solution. In this study, six alternative cropping systems’ water conservation and food supply capacity were compared simultaneously. A combined water footprint method was applied to analyze the cropping systems’ water consumption. The winter wheat–summer maize system had the largest water consumption (16,585 m3/ha on average), followed by the potato/spring maize, spinach–spring maize, rye–spring maize, vetch–spring maize, pea/spring maize, soybean||spring maize and mono-spring maize cropping systems. For the groundwater, the spinach–spring maize, pea/spring maize, soybean||spring maize systems showed a higher degree of synchronization between crop growth period and rainfall, which could reduce use of groundwater by 36.8%, 54.4% and 57.6%, respectively. For food supply capacity, the values for spinach–spring maize, pea/spring maize, soybean||spring maize systems were 73.0%, 60.8% and 48.4% of winter wheat–summer maize, respectively, but they showed a better feeding efficiency than the winter wheat–summer maize system. On the whole, spinach–spring maize may be a good option to prevent further decline in groundwater level and to ensure food security in a sustainable way.","Global warming has become one of the major challenges in maintaining global food security. This paper reviews the impacts of climate change on fourteen strategic crops for eight sub-Saharan Africa countries. Climate change is projected to increase median temperature by 1.4–5.5°C and median precipitation by −2% to 20% by the end of the 21st century. However, large levels of uncertainty exist with temporal and spatial variability of rainfall events. The impact of climate change on crop yields in the region is largely negative. Among the grain crops, wheat is reported as the most vulnerable crop, for which up to 72% of the current yield is projected to decline. For other grain crops, such as maize, rice and soybean, up to 45% yield reductions are expected by the end of this century. Two grain crops, millet and sorghum, are more resilient to climate change for which projected impacts on crop yields are <20%. Root crops, such as sweet potato, potato and cassava are projected to be less affected than the grain crops with changes to crop yields ranging from about −15% to 10%. For the two major export crops, tea and coffee, up to 40% yield loss is expected due to the reduction in suitable areas caused by temperature increase. Similar loss of suitable areas is also expected for banana and sugarcane production, however, this reduction is due to rainfall variability in lowland areas. Other crops such as cotton and sugarcane are projected to be more susceptible to precipitation variation that will vary significantly in the region. In order to mitigate the long-term impacts of climate change on agricultural sectors, the development of small-scale irrigation systems and water harvesting structures seems promising, however, affordability of such measures remains a key issue.","Achieving an economically feasible and environmentally robust model in agriculture while satisfying the expanding population’s food demands is a global challenge. Hence, a three-year (2014–2017) study was conducted at Punjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana to design environmentally clean, energy-efficient, and profitable cropping systems. Twelve cropping systems viz., rice-wheat (CS1), basmati rice-hayola (transplanted)-mung bean (CS2), basmati rice-radish-maize (CS3), maize-potato-maize (CS4), maize + turmeric-barley + linseed (CS5), maize + turmeric-wheat + linseed (CS6), maize + radish-wheat + linseed-mung bean (CS7), groundnut + pigeon pea (5:1)-wheat + sarson (9:1) (CS8), maize + black gram-pea (bed) + celery (furrows) (CS9),: maize + pigeon pea-chickpea (bed) + gobhi sarson (furrows) (CS10), maize (green cobs) + vegetable cowpea + dhaincha (Sesbania spp.)-chickpea + gobhi sarson (CS11) and sorghum + cowpea (fodder)-wheat + gobhi sarson (9:1) (CS12) were tested in a four-times-replicated randomized block design. CS11 had the maximum system productivity (28.57 Mg ha−1), production efficiency (78.27 Kg Day−1 ha−1), irrigation water use efficiency (2.38 kg m−3), system net returns (4413.3 US$ ha−1), and benefit to cost (B:C) ratio (2.83) over others. In comparison to the CS1 system, this cropping system required ~78% less irrigation water for a unit economic production. However, the cultivation of CS12 registered the highest energy use efficiency (49.06%), net energy returns (6.46 × 103 MJ ha⁻¹), and global warming potential (GWP) (Mg CO2 e ha−1) at spatial scale. Among all the intensified systems, CS11 had the lowest GHGI (0.29 kg CO2 e kg−1). Furthermore, cultivation of CS6 resulted in the maximum bacterial and actinomycetes population in the soil, while CS5 yielded the highest fungal count (23.8 × 103 cfu g−1 dry soil) in soil. Our study suggests that the cultivation of CS11 is a resource-efficient, economically viable, and environmentally clean production system and could be a potential alternative to rice-wheat systems for developing a green economy policy for agricultural development in the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) of India.","Survey was conducted in villages Digsara, Basirpur Mar, Pokhra and Bhavanipur under Jalalabad block of Kannauj districts to analyze the crop diversification systems during 2015–16. The major cropping systems included potato-groundnut/maize; paddy-potato-maize; paddy-wheat-green manuring; groundnut/maize-potato-maize; maizemustard- maize and green manuring-early potato-wheat/seed potato. It was observed that summer groundnut was fast replaced by summer maize despite higher water requirement in summer maize (6–7 irrigation) than groundnut (3–4 irrigation) as farmers were getting higher yield (60–70 q/ha) in summer maize than groundnut (Yield: 37–40 q/ ha).Summer groundnut was perceived more sustainable than summer maize as the underground water level was fast depleting in these area (declining at the rate of 2 ft. every year). Wheat crop was getting marginalized among small land holders. Major cropping systems followed by such farmers were fallow/dhaincha-potato-maize; maize-potatomaize and maize-early potato-wheat (very less area). Diversification with mixed cropping of minor vegetables likes coriander and kharif onion was also analyzed in these districts. Flower cultivation based crop diversification was documented in this study. It was found that flowers like rose, bela (jasmine) and mehndi (henna) were cultivated by the majority of farmers to address the industrial requirements in the district for making edible products of roses as well as perfumes. Potato+rose was the most frequently utilized cropping pattern as the fertilizer requirements of roses were being met from the residual nutrients of potato.The study recommends that the diversity in cropping systems among the small holders ought to be safeguarded and supported with the appropriate development interventions.","In the North China Plain, groundwater tables have been dropping at unsustainable rates of 1 m per year due to irrigation of a double cropping system of winter wheat and summer maize. To reverse the trend, we examined whether alternative crop rotations could save water. Moisture contents were measured weekly at 20 cm intervals in the top 180 cm of soil as part of a 12-year field experiment with four crop rotations: sweet potato→ cotton→ sweet potato→ winter wheat-summer maize (SpCSpWS, 4-year cycle); peanuts → winter wheat-summer maize (PWS, 2-year cycle); ryegrass–cotton→ peanuts→ winter wheat-summer maize (RCPWS, 3-year cycle); and winter wheat-summer maize (WS, each year). We found that, compared to WS, the SpCSpWS annual evapotranspiration was 28% lower, PWS was 19% lower and RCPWS was 14% lower. The yield per unit of water evaporated improved for wheat within any alternative rotation compared to WS, increasing up to 19%. Average soil moisture contents at the sowing date of wheat in the SpCSpWS, PWS, and RCPWS rotations were 7, 4, and 10% higher than WS, respectively. The advantage of alternative rotations was that a deep rooted crop of winter wheat reaching down to 180 cm followed shallow rooted crops (sweet potato and peanut drawing soil moisture from 0 to 120 cm). They benefited from the sequencing and vertical complementarity of soil moisture extraction. Thus, replacing the traditional crop rotation with cropping system that involves rotating with annual shallow rooted crops is promising for reducing groundwater depletion in the North China Plain.",17.1718444846357

Undernutrition is the more common form of malnutrition in developing countries, and results from insufficient intake of protein and/or energy, and may sometimes result from poor breastfeeding and/or complementary feeding practices. WHO recommends exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of the baby’s life, followed by gradual introduction of complementary foods, with continuous breastfeeding till baby is at least two years. Most babies are not exclusively breastfed for six months, and even more not breastfed till 24 months. Most complementary foods in developing countries are homemade, with plant-based ingredients, using improper processing techniques, making them low in nutrient content. Aims: This work aimed at formulating Complementary foods from ten different proportions of local staples; yellow maize, rice, potatoes, egg whites, soybeans, pawpaw, watermelon, pineapple and oranges, using standard processing techniques. Methodology: The blends (A to J) were formulated and were evaluated for colour, taste, flavor and consistency using nine scaled hedonic point, and the preferred five were evaluated for proximate composition, some vitamins and minerals, functional properties, and for microbes using standard Association of Analytical Chemists (AOAC) methods. The results were statistically analysed using Microsoft excel, SPSS and Graphpad Instat softwares. Results: Results from sensory analysis showed that the preferred formulas were B, H, A, C, G, respectively. Moisture contents ranged from 4.6 - 10.5%, ash content ranged from 2.65 - 3.70%, fibre content ranged from 6.43 - 9.27%, protein content ranged from 17.72 - 37.72%, fat content ranged from 9.5 - 14%, carbohydrate content ranged from 38.74 - 63.58%, and energy content ranged from 394.9Kcal - 433.2Kcal. Micronutrient analysis revealed that all the formulas had no vitamin C, while they had vitamin A contents ranging from 95.85 - 2340IU. Calcium content ranged from 378 - 632mg/100g, iron content ranged from 4.73 - 8.59mg/100g, phosphorous ranged from 109.04 - 136.49mg/100g, and Zinc content ranged from 1.47 - 2.35mg/100g. Magnesium content ranged from 53.32 - 85.19mg/100g, sodium ranged from 2.42 - 189.41mg/100g, while potassium ranged from 319.2 - 728.82mg/100g. For functional properties, water absorption and oil absorption capacities ranged from 1.5 - 4.4 and 1.5 - 1.95 respectively, Loose and packaged bulk densities ranged from 0.51 - 0.54 and 0.78 - 0.92 respectively. The swelling index ranged from 1.03 - 1.11, foaming capacity and foam stability ranged from 2.0 - 18.0 and 0.0 - 0.7 respectively, while the dispersibilities ranged from 52.5 - 92.5%. Microbial analysis revealed that none of the formulas contained yeast, C had no coliform while formula B had highest coliform (620 CFUs), while C had highest TBC (31000CFUs). Conclusion: Formula C, with sweet potatoes as main starch source, looked most promising as a complementary food.","Porridge is an important complementary food in many developing countries and it is mainly prepared from different blended flour. It is however, relatively cheap or inexpensive, being made from local available crop. In line with this, research was initiated to produce porridge from formulated with germinated maize, soybean and sweet potato flour to investigate the possibilities of improving the proximate composition, functional and sensory properties of complementary porridge. Nine -formulations of the composite flour were prepared using mixture design using Minitab software of version 16with a range of Germinated maize 30-70%, soybean20-40% and sweet potato 10-30%. Results showed significance difference (p<0.05) in bulk density of the composite flour. High blending ratio of soybean increased Moisture content, ash content and the sensory property like appearance taste and over all acceptability, whereas sweet potato increased the water absorption capacity of blended flour, oil absorption capacity blended flour and also increase aroma, taste of sensory property of porridge .The overall optimum point of all parameters are (moisture content4.4-5.06%, ash content1.8-5.4%, water absorption capacity200-131%, oil absorption capacity170.3-109 %, bulk density 0.4-0.2g/ml, and overall acceptance received hedonic ratings 4-4.75 were found in a range of germinated maize 30-70%, soybean 20-40% and sweet potato 10-20%. Therefore the study will be beneficial to most of the society who use porridge as important complementary food for his children.","Abstract Malnutrition and food insecurity are major public health problems in developing countries including Ethiopia. Because of an economic issue and information gap, developing countries' survival depends on foods rich in carbohydrates but deficient in protein and micronutrients. However, it is paramount to mix ingredients that complement different nutritional profiles to alleviate the problem of malnutrition. Hence, in this research, maize, orange‐fleshed sweet potato, sweet lupine, and moringa leaf powder composites were used to develop nutritious instant porridge flour through extrusion cooking. Formulations containing powdered maize, orange‐fleshed sweet potato, sweet lupine, and moringa leaf were developed in the following ratios: 100:0:0:0, 50:35:10:5, 45:30:15:10, and 40:25:20:15, respectively. A completely randomized design was used to determine the blending effect on the functional properties, proximate composition, minerals, and beta‐carotene content of formulated instant porridge flour. Whereas, a randomized complete block design was used for the organoleptic characteristics data. Accordingly, the addition of orange‐fleshed sweet potato, sweet lupine, and moringa leaf powder to maize‐based porridge showed a significant (p < .05) increase in bulk density (0.70 ± 0.02 to 0.74 ± 0.03), water solubility index (10.09 ± 0.08 to 14.16 ± 0.23), protein (9.00 ± 0.00 to 21.10 ± 0.02), ash (1.43 ± 0.07 to 3.36 ± 0.08), fiber (1.55 ± 0.05 to 3.21 ± 0.01), fat (3.37 ± 0.02 to 5.37 ± 0.07), energy (370.89 ± 0.70 to 400.53 ± 0.65), vitamin A (0.00 to 41.00 ± 1.55), iron (3.49 ± 0.02 to 9.58 ± 0.29), zinc (2.89 ± 0.01 to 3.62 ± 0.06), and calcium (40.49 ± 0.42 to 113.34 ± 0.52) contents. However, water absorption index (4.76 ± 0.01 to 3.84 ± 0.01), moisture (8.50 ± 0.08 to 5.60 ± 0.04), and carbohydrate (76.11 ± 0.22 to 66.94 ± 0.02) content were decreased as a result of blending proportion compared to maize porridge (control). Formulated instant maize‐based porridge prepared from 50% maize, 35% orange‐fleshed sweet potato, 10% sweet lupine, and 5% moringa leaf powder scored the highest (above 4 out of 5 in a 5‐point hedonic scale) in all sensory attributes. In conclusion, the addition of orange‐fleshed sweet potato, sweet lupine flour, and moringa leaf powder has improved both macro‐ and micronutrients. Therefore, the development of nutritious maize‐based instant porridge formulated from readily available and underutilized crops can be achieved by extrusion cooking that helps to reduce the prevalence of malnutrition and food insecurity.","Mycotoxins produced by fungi are among the leading courses of human mortality and morbidity all over the world. This study aimed at establishing the post-harvest practices that lead to contamination of maize with fungi in Trans Nzoia, Kisii, Kisumu, Bungoma, Migori, Kericho, Machakos, Kitui and Meru Counties in Kenya. The study was also aimed at isolating the most common mycotoxin producing fungi from maize samples collected from the study areas. The post-harvest practices were determined using a questionnaire. From each county, a total of 130 maize samples were collected. The samples from each county were mixed to make a composite sample. The moisture content of the maize samples were determined and percentage moisture content calculated. Each sample was ground using a dry mill kitchen blender (BL335, Kenwood, UK). A sample of 1g was suspended in 9mL of sterile distilled water and serial dilution up to 10 -2 carried out. A sample of 0.01mL was plated on potato dextrose agar. Mycotoxin producing fungi were identified using morphological characteristics and fungal identification keys. The postharvest practices within the counties varied significantly. The mean moisture content of stored maize varied from 16.78% in Kitui to 19.33% in Trans Nzoia. The number of mycotoxin producing fungi ranged from 10.33 CFU/g in Machakos to 61.00CFU/g in Trans Nzoia. This study established that the post-harvest practices observed in the study areas led to contamination of maize with mycroflora. In addition, the moisture content levels of stored maize in the counties favoured growth of mycotoxin producing fungi. There is need to identify the mycotoxins produced by the mycotoxin producing fungi isolated in this study.","Potato dextrose and malt extract agar were found to be suitable for culturing different isolates of Pyricularia oryzae. Colonies of P. oryzae appeared as white on oat meal, rice polish and malt extract agar, grey on potato dextrose agar and whitish grey on rice agar. Spore induction was hastened on maize stem pieces than on rice and Panicum repens. Spore density on maize was 3420/ml of water as against 500/ml on P. repens. When spores of 11 isolates of P. oryzae were compared, conidia of the isolate from Pennisetum purpureum were significantly bigger than the other isolates. The spores of rice isolates from Erode and Gopichettipalayam were significantly smaller in length and width.Fingerprinting of 11 isolates of P. oryzae by retrotransposon - microsatellite amplified polymorphism (REMAP) showed a high level of variability and polymorphism among them. Phylogenetic analysis using REMAP markers grouped out one rice isolate from others. Two isolates of Tirunelveli region were grouped together like Erode and Gopichettipalayam isolates. Isolates causing leaf and neck blast showed 52.9% similarity. Isolates from Coimbatore and Gudalore were 32.7% similar; likewise two non-rice host isolates were grouped together with 27.6% similarity.   Key words: Variability, culture media, rice blast, Pyricularia oryzae, retrotransposon, microsatellite.","This article deals with physicochemical, thermal and functional properties of cereals (maize), pulses (Bengal gram) vegetables (potato flour), oil seed (peanut, soybean), sweetener (sugar and glucose powder), milk powder, soybean oil, emulsifier (lecithin and Mono Di glyceride) and vitamin & mineral premix used for the preparation of ready to eat therapeutic health food for malnourished children. The physical (bulk and true density, porosity and flowability), chemical (moisture, fat, protein and total energy), thermal properties (thermal conductivity, thermal diffusivity and volumetric specific heat) and functional properties (protein digestibility) were determined using standard protocols. The bulk density, particle and porosity of raw and processed ingredients were varied from 0.54 to 1.37 g/cc, 1.03 to 2.37 g/cc and 0.40 to 0.60 % respectively. The water activity (a w ), flowability, thermal conductivity, thermal diffusivity and specific heat were 0.02 to 0.76, 4 to 18 S, 0.071 to 0.214 W/mk, 0.0032 to 0.890 mm 2 /s and 1.24 x 10-3 to 0.52 MJ/m 3 k, respectively. The roasted soybean flour has maximum (82%) protein digestibility; the respective data for the roasted peanut paste was (79%) and roasted Bengal gram flour (79%).","In this study, the rheological properties and sugar profiles of a maize-based (maize flour, sweet potato leaf and root flour) complementary food for 12 to 23 month-old Ugandan children were evaluated. Two foods were formulated. Treatment 1 (T1) was made of 70% maize meal, 15% sweet potato root flour and 15% sweet potato leaf flour, while Treatment 2 (T2) consisted of 70% maize meal, 20% sweetpotato root flour and 10% sweetpotato leaf flour. Both formulations had equal amounts of sugar, oil and added water. The viscosity of the complementary foods was determined at 45oC by two different methods (rheometer and line spread test). The viscosity decreased with increasing temperature for all the samples. The viscosity at 45°C for the Control, T1 and T2 were 1.35, 1.96 and 0.86 Pa, respectively. There were significantly (P <0.05) different line spread measurements among the samples; however, the control sample flowed the greatest distance. The highest level of sugarswas found in T2 (5.1±2.7 g/100g) versus the control, which had the least amount of total sugar (2.9±1.6 g/100g). Supplementation of a maize-based complementary food with sweetpotato root and sweet potato leaf flours improves the viscosity and sugar profile.","High-voltage electrical discharge (HVED) is considered as a novel, non-thermal process and is currently being researched regarding its effect on microorganisms (decontamination of food), waste water treatment, and modification of different compounds and food components. In this paper, four native starches (maize, wheat, potato, and tapioca) were treated with HVED, phosphorylated with Na2HPO4 and Na5P3O10, and modified by a combination of HVED with each phosphorylation reaction both prior and after chemical modification. Pasting properties, swelling power, solubility, gel texture, and particle size were analyzed. Although HVED induced lower contents of P in modified starches, it had an effect on analyzed properties. The results revealed that HVED treatment alone had a limited effect on pasting properties of starches, but it had an effect on properties of phosphorylated starches, both when it was conducted prior and after the chemical modification, reducing the influence of Na5P3O10 and Na2HPO4 on the decrease of pasting temperature. With minor exceptions, the gel strength of starches increased, and the rupture strength decreased by all modifications. HVED treatment resulted in a decrease of the particle size after the modification of maize and wheat starches, while potato and tapioca starches were not significantly influenced by the treatment.","Lampung province is one of production center for food commodities such as cassava, maize and sweet potato. The development of these commodities into processed products has been done one of which is a composite flour. The purpose of this study was to determine the physicochemical characteristics of composite flour consisting of a mixture of cassava flour (CF), sweet potato flour (SPF) and corn flour (NF). The study was conducted in the Laboratory of Lampung Assessment Institute for  Agriculture  Technology (AIAT) and Laboratory of Food Chemistry and Technology, Indonesian Legumes and Tuber Crops Research Institute (ILETRI) on May – July 2014. The design used was completely randomized by four treatments such as F1 (60% CF, 0% SPF, 35% NF, 5% Rice Bran/RB ), F2 (50% CF, 10% SPF, 35% NF, 5% RB), F3 (40% CF, 20% SPF, 35% NF, 5% RB) and F4 (30% CF, 30% SPF, 35% NF, 5% RB), and the activities was repeated 4 times. The data were statistically analyzed and followed by Duncan Multiple range test. Physical characteristics observed were whiteness, water content, water absorption value (NPA) and the water solubility value (NKA). While the chemical characteristics of proximate analysis consist of moisture content, protein, carbohydrates, fat, fiber and ash content by AOAC Methods. The results showed that the whiteness value of four composite flours were not different in the ranged between 57.97% (F4) and 60.37% (F1). While the carbohydrates content ranged from 81.17 to 83.3% (the highest in the F4), protein was from 3.70 to 4.47% (the highest in the F4), fat was from 1.41 to 1.50%, ash content was from 01.47 - 1.66%, 1.81 - 2.17% for crude fiber, 11.64 to 18.80% for amylose, while amylopectin content ranged from 36.68 to 43.98%.","Most snacks are prepared from basically cereal flours which are nutritionally inadequate. There is the need to complement the nutrient content of these snacks by varying the food sources. Chin-chin snacks were produced from composite flours of Maize, soybean and OFSP with the following formation; sample A (50%: 25%: 25%), B (25%: 25%: 50%), C (25%: 50%: 25%), D (0%: 50%: 50%) and E (50%: 50%: 0%). Wheat flour (100%) served as the control F. The flour bends were analysed for functional properties while the chin-chin snacks were analysed for their nutrient and sensory qualities. The result of functional properties of the flours showed that bulk density of wheat flour (F) was the highest (0.746 g/ml). OFSP flour enhanced the water absorption capacity of the flour blends. Flour blends with soybean recorded higher values in foam capacity (11.20 - 22.55%). In proximate composition, the moisture was low (3.80 – 4.80%) in the chin-chin. Higher fibre content (2.60 - 4.20%) was obtained in samples containing higher proportion (50%) of OFSP. Samples D (19.38%) and C (18.80%) with higher soybean, recorded higher protein values. The mineral and the vitamin contents of snacks from composite flours were higher than that of the control F. Vitamin B1, B2, B3 and β-carotene contents of the snacks were enhanced by OFSP. The sensory evaluation showed preference for snack F (100% wheat flour) followed by snack A (50% maize, 25% soybean and 25% OFSP). However, improved nutrient dense chin-chin snacks were produced from the composite flours.",27.0168921064237

A located experiment was conducted in 2015 and 2016 for two con-secutive years, and six ridge-and-furrow rainwater harvesting with mulching patterns were set up in dry farmland of southern Ningxia. Ridges were mulched with plastic film, while furrows were covered with plastic film (PP), maize straw (PS), biodegradable film (PB), bast fiber film (PF), liquid film (PL), and furrow without mulching (PN), and the flat planting without mulching was used as control check (CK). We investigated the effect of ridge-and-furrow rainwater harvesting with mulching on soil water, temperature, nutrients, and potato yield. Furrow-and-ridge rainwater harvesting with mulching patterns could significantly increase averag e soil water storage in 0–200 cm layer during the whole growth period, and PS treatment had the best effect on soil water conservation. Compared with CK, PP treatment significantly increased topsoil temperature (0–25 cm) during the growth period, while PS treatment significantly reduced topsoil temperature in potato. Compared with the treatment before the experiment, the contents of soil organic carbon, total nitrogen, alkali-hydrolysed nitrogen, and available phosphorus in 0–40 cm layer under different furrow-and-ridge rainwater harvesting with mulching patterns were significantly increased, while the soil available potassium contents were significantly decreased during the two-year experiments. Compared with the control, the soil nutrients with different furrow-and-ridge rainwater harvesting with mulching patterns were significantly increased with the largest increase in soil nutrients in PS treatment. Ridge-and-furrow rainwater harvesting with mulching patterns could significantly improve potato yield and marketable tuber rate, and PS and PP treatments were the highest, followed by PB, PF, and PL treatments, while there was no significant difference between PN and CK treatments. According to correlation and path analysis, the soil water, organic carbon, and temperature were the important factors limiting the high yield of potato. The ridge mulched with plastic film and furrow covered with straw could significantly increase potato yield by improving the soil water, temperature, and nutrient environ-ment in dryland. It had certain application value in high yield cultivation of potato in arid areas of southern Ningxia.","The practice of crop rotation can significantly impact carbon sequestration potential. In exploring whether crop rotation has the potential to improve soil carbon sequestration in China’s Loess Plateau, soil organic carbon (SOC), soil water content (SWC), soil bulk density (SBD), and soil pH were compared across the 0–1.0 m soil profile, under four crop rotation patterns: lentil–wheat–maize, wheat–potato–lentil, wheat–maize–potato, and wheat–flax–pea. The lentil–wheat–maize and wheat–maize–potato rotations have been practiced over the past 20 years, while the wheat–potato–lentil and wheat–flax–pea rotations were established in 1978 (~40 year rotations). The results showed that under the 20-year lentil–wheat–maize rotation, SOC was not significantly different to that of the wheat–maize–potato rotation, at 6.81 g kg−1 and 6.91 g kg−1, respectively. However, under the lentil–wheat–maize rotation, SWC (9.81%) and SBD (1.19 Mg m−3) were significantly higher, but soil pH (8.42) was significantly lower than the same metrics under wheat–maize–potato rotation (8.43% and 1.16 Mg m−3, and 8.50, respectively). For the 40-year rotations, SWC (9.19%) and soil pH (8.41) under the wheat–potato–lentil were not significantly different to that of the wheat–flax–pea (8.87%, and 8.40, respectively). SOC (6.06 g kg−1) was significantly lower, but SBD (1.18 Mg m−3) was significantly higher under the wheat–potato–lentil than the wheat–flax–pea (7.29 g kg−1, and 1.15 Mg m−3, respectively) rotations. Soil carbon sequestration for the lentil–wheat–maize and wheat–potato–lentil rotations was co-influenced by SWC, SBD, and soil pH, while for wheat–maize–potato and wheat–flax–pea rotations, it was co-influenced by SWC and soil pH. The economic value of the four studied crops is, in order: potato > maize > wheat > flax. The results of the present study suggest that the lentil–wheat–maize and maize–flax–pea rotations are the most suitable patterns to optimize simultaneous economic and ecological development of the study area.","Exploring crop yield stability and the relationship between the water–fertilizer effect and annual precipitation type in a broomcorn millet–potato–spring corn rotation system under long-term fertilization on chestnut cinnamon soil in loess tableland can provide a scientific basis for rational fertilization in the northwest Shanxi region in years with different precipitation. This study was based on a 33-year long-term fertilizer experiment, using four fertilizer treatments: no fertilizer as control (CT), single fertilizer nitrogen (N), single organic fertilizer (M), and nitrogen fertilizer with organic fertilizer (NM). The results showed that broomcorn millet and maize had the highest yield in wet years, while potatoes had the highest yield in normal years and the yield under NM treatment was the highest. The sustainable yield index (SYI) values for potato and maize were higher than the SYI for the broomcorn millet during years with different precipitation and the SYI for the NM treatment was the highest. The water use efficiency of NM treatment was the highest. The yield of broomcorn millet and maize was affected by nitrogen fertilizer, organic fertilizer, and precipitation during the growth period, while the potato yield was mainly affected by nitrogen fertilizer and organic fertilizer. Therefore, the rotation of potato–maize and the rational allocation of organic and inorganic fertilizer (NM) is the best planting system in this region.","This paper describes impact analyses of various soil water flow regimes on grass, maize and potato yields in the Dutch delta, with a focus on upward soil water flows capillary rise and recirculation towards the rootzone. Flow regimes are characterised by soil composition and groundwater depth and derived from a national soil database. The intermittent occurrence of upward flow and its influence on crop growth are simulated with the combined SWAP-WOFOST model using various boundary conditions. Case studies and model experiments are used to illustrate impact of upward flow on yield and crop growth. This impact is clearly present in situations with relatively shallow groundwater levels (85 % of the Netherlands), where capillary rise is the main flow source; but also in free-draining situations the impact of upward flow is considerable. In the latter case recirculated percolation water is the flow source. To make this impact explicit we implemented a synthetic modelling option that stops upward flow from reaching the root zone, without inhibiting percolation. Such a hypothetically moisture-stressed situation compared to a natural one in the presence of shallow groundwater shows mean yield reductions for grassland, maize and potatoes of respectively 25, 4 and 15 % or respectively about 3.2, 0.5 and 1.6 ton dry matter per ha. About half of the withheld water behind these yield effects comes from recirculated percolation water as occurs in free drainage conditions and the other half comes from increased upward capillary rise. Soil water and crop growth modelling should consider both capillary rise from groundwater and recirculation of percolation water as this improves the accuracy of yield simulations. This also improves the accuracy of the simulated groundwater recharge: neglecting these processes causes overestimates of 17 % for grassland and 46 % for potatoes, or 70 and 34 mm a −1 , respectively.","Abstract. Upward soil water flow is a vital supply of water to crops. The purpose of this study is to determine if upward flow and recirculated percolation water can be quantified separately, and to determine the contribution of capillary rise and recirculated water to crop yield and groundwater recharge. Therefore, we performed impact analyses of various soil water flow regimes on grass, maize and potato yields in the Dutch delta. Flow regimes are characterized by soil composition and groundwater depth and derived from a national soil database. The intermittent occurrence of upward flow and its influence on crop growth are simulated with the combined SWAP-WOFOST model using various boundary conditions. Case studies and model experiments are used to illustrate the impact of upward flow on yield and crop growth. This impact is clearly present in situations with relatively shallow groundwater levels (85 % of the Netherlands), where capillary rise is a well-known source of upward flow; but also in free-draining situations the impact of upward flow is considerable. In the latter case recirculated percolation water is the flow source. To make this impact explicit we implemented a synthetic modelling option that stops upward flow from reaching the root zone, without inhibiting percolation. Such a hypothetically moisture-stressed situation compared to a natural one in the presence of shallow groundwater shows mean yield reductions for grassland, maize and potatoes of respectively 26, 3 and 14 % or respectively about 3.7, 0.3 and 1.5 t dry matter per hectare. About half of the withheld water behind these yield effects comes from recirculated percolation water as occurs in free-drainage conditions and the other half comes from increased upward capillary rise. Soil water and crop growth modelling should consider both capillary rise from groundwater and recirculation of percolation water as this improves the accuracy of yield simulations. This also improves the accuracy of the simulated groundwater recharge: neglecting these processes causes overestimates of 17 % for grassland and 46 % for potatoes, or 63 and 34 mm yr−1, respectively.","Soil carbon transformation was observed in long-term stationary field experiments (longer than 20 years) at two sites with different soil-climatic conditions (Luvisol, Chernozem). The following crops were rotated within the trial: row crops (potatoes or maize)-winter wheat-spring barley. All three crops were grown each year. Four different fertilization treatments were used: (a) no fertilizer (control); (b) sewage sludge (9.383 t dry matter/ha/3 years); (c) farmyard manure (15.818 t dry matter/ha/3 years); (d) mineral NPK fertilization (330 kg N, 90 kg P, 300 kg K/ha/3 years). At the Luvisol site, the control treatment showed a tendency to decrease organic carbon (Corg) in topsoil. At organic fertilization treatments the content of Corg increased: sewage sludge – +15.0% (Luvisol) and +21.8% (Chernozem), farmyard manure – +19.0% (Luvisol) and +15.9% (Chernozem). At the NPK fertilization, the increase was +4.8% (Luvisol) and +4.7% (Chernozem). The increased Corg content was also associated with an increase of microbial biomass carbon (Cmic) and extractable organic carbon (0.01 mol/L CaCl2 and hot water extraction). The ratio of Cmic in Corg was within the range 0.93–1.37%.","Abstract. This paper describes analyses of different soil water flow regimes on growth and yields of grass, maize and potato crops in the Dutch delta, with a focus on the role of capillary rise. Different flow regimes are characterised by differences in soil composition and structure are derived from a national soil database. Capillary rise and its influence on crop growth and resulting yields is simulated using Swap-Wofost with different boundary conditions. Case studies and model experiments are used to illustrate the impact of capillary rise. This impact is clearly present in situations where a groundwater level is present (85 % of NL) but also in other situations the impact of capillary rise on crop growth and production is considerable. When one compares situations with average groundwater levels with free drainage conditions without capillary rise yield-reductions of grassland, maize and potatoes are respectively 25, 4 and 15 % or respectively about 3.2, 0.5 and 1.6 ton dry Matter per ha. Neglecting capillary rise also has impact on the downward leaching water flux, the groundwater recharge. Impact can be considerable; for grassland and potatoes the reduction is 17 and 46 % or 64 and 34 mm. Modelling of soil water flow should consider capillary rise of soil water which will results in improved yield and downward leaching simulations.","To explore soil nutrients and moisture changes in different karst mountain agroforestry, in the plateau mountains of Southern China Karst, we used secondary tree and irrigation forest (C) as a reference for our study and selected four mixed agroforestry species (walnut + maize + potato (HYM), walnut + maize (HTY), poplar + ryegrass (YSH), and maize + ryegrass (YMH)) for comparison. First, soil moisture change characteristics were monitored in situ in the field. Second, for soil samples, soil bulk density, porosity, and permeability were analyzed, soil nutrient (K, Na, Ca, and Mg) characteristics were tested and analyzed. Then, we explored the relationship between agroforestry and soil moisture, soil moisture and soil nutrients, soil moisture and precipitation, and agroforestry and soil nutrients. It is shown (1) during the monitored period, variation trends in soil nutrients in four types of agroforestry was small, but it increased/decreased significantly compared with the secondary forest, which the variation range was more than 5%; (2) the changes of soil water content were significantly affected by precipitation, soil porosity and permeability, the moisture content changes of HYM, HTY, YSH, and YMH agroforestry were significantly correlated with precipitation, soil porosity, and permeability; (3) under the same precipitation conditions, different types had different lags on soil water regulation, with the average HYM 0.8 h, HTY 0.6 h, YSH 0.3 h, and YMH 0.4 h, each type soil responded at 2–3 h after rain, and the soil moisture content returned to the normal level; and (4) the variation of soil moisture content fluctuated seasonally, and the most obvious was HYM and HTY agroforestry, their Cv value between winter and summer exceeded 21%. The results provide basic theoretical support for further exploring the relationship among agroforestry, soil, moisture, and nutrients and enrich the content of the development of agroforestry in karst areas. They are of importance to promote ecological restoration and agroforestry development in karst areas.","BackgroundThe success of soil management depends on understanding of how soils respond to agricultural land use practices over time. Nitisols are among the most extensive agricultural soils in the Ethiopian highlands but soil degradation threatens their productive capacity. In this study, the effects of two land use systems, intensive cereal and agroforestry systems, and slope class on physical and chemical characteristics of some Nitisol profiles were investigated. In total 12 sample profiles were described and soil samples were collected from each of the identified master horizon. Soil physical characteristics evaluated were particle size distribution, structural aggregate stability, water holding capacity and bulk density. Chemical characteristics determined were exchangeable bases and cation exchange capacity, soil pH and the contents of organic carbon (OC), total nitrogen (TN), available phosphorus (AP) and some micronutrients.ResultsAmong the physical characteristics, land use and slope significantly (p < 0.05) affected particle size distribution and plant available water content. The mean sand (28%) and silt (26%) particles in the intensive cereal system were significantly (p < 0.05) higher compared to 15% sand and 18% silt in the agroforestry system. Conversely, the mean values of fine grained texture materials including 39% fine sand, 42% fine silt and 67% clay in the agroforestry system were significantly higher than 30% fine sand, 21% fine silt and 46% clay in the cereal system. Similarly, the lower slope had significantly (p < 0.05) higher fin texture materials (39% fine sand, 30% fine silt, and 63%) clay) compared to 17% fine sand, 14% fine silt and 51% clay fractions in the upper slope. The proportion of water stable aggregate (WSA) were highlight (63–94%) and there was no significant difference between land types and slope classes. Following from high structural aggregate stability, the soils have high water holding capacity that ranged from 22 to 32% at PWP to 34–49% at FC while plant available water content (AWC) was in the 120–230 mm m−1 range. Considering the chemical characteristics, land use significantly affected soil pH, total nitrogen (TN), exchangeable magnesium (Mg2+), potassium (K+), percent base saturation (PBS), and available micro nutrients—iron (Fe2+), manganese (Mn2+) and zinc (Zn2+). The mean pH value (5.29) in the intensive cereal system strongly acidic while the pH value for the agroforestry system (6.12) was taken moderately acidic. The mean OC content was 2.0 and 2.1% for the intensive cereal and agroforestry systems that were rated very low. The mean TN values were 0.15 and 0.22% for intensive cereal and agroforestry systems that were taken as low to very low. Similarly the mean values for AP were 8 and 10 mg kg−1 for cereal and agroforestry systems that were rated low. On the other hand, the CEC, exchangeable bases (Ca2+, Mg2+, K+) and PBS of the soil were rated high while Na+ appeared only in trace amount, and there was no significant difference between land use type and slope classes except for Mg2+, K+ and PBS. Mean values of Mg2+ and K+ (15 and 3 cmol(+) kg−1) and PBS (75%) in the agroforestry system were significantly higher than those in the cereal system (6 and 1.6 cmol(+) kg−1 of Mg2+ and K+ and 51% PBS). Among micronutrients, land use significantly (p < 0.05) affected available Fe2+, Mn2+ and Zn+. The mean values of Fe2+ (97 mg kg−1) and Mn2+ (68 mg kg−1) in the agroforestry system were taken as excessively high while they were moderately sufficient (37, 39 mg kg−1, respectively) in the cereal system. Slope effects were significant for OC, TN and AP having higher mean values (2.5% OC, 0.22% TN and 17 mg kg−1 AP) in the lower slope than in the upper slope (1.5% OC, 0.13% TN and 8 mg kg−1 AP).ConclusionLand use and slope had significant effect on some soil physical and chemical characteristics. The land use practices in the intensive cereal system are adversely affecting important soil characteristics as compared to the soil under the agroforestry system. These include alteration of particle size distribution, strongly acidic soil reaction, organic matter and nutrient depletion (N, P, K and Zn) and low plant available water content. Among the inappropriate land use practices include repeated cultivation to create fine seedbed that predisposes the soil to erosion, unbalanced fertilizer application, rotation of maize with potato that are depleting soil nutrient stocks (e., K and Zn), and removal of crop residues from fields. Therefore, a more balanced fertilizer blend application that contain N, P, K and Zn combined with liming to raise soil pH, organic matter management and integrated soil water conservation are recommended.","To explore the yield-increasing mechanism of mechanized potato planting with corn straw mulching, a two-year (2021 and 2022) field experiment was conducted to study the effects of mechanized no-tillage with straw mulching on potato yield and water use efficiency. This experiment included mechanized no-tillage potato planting with corn straw mulch covering (JG), plastic film mulching (HM), and open flat planting (CK). The results showed that mechanical no-tillage with straw mulching significantly affected soil water content in the 0–100 cm soil layer, yield, and water use efficiency (p < 0.05). There was no significant difference in yield between JG and HM, but it was significantly higher than that of CK. The yield of JG was 3.09~12.27% higher than that of CK. The yield increase was mainly achieved by increasing the potato weight per plant (0.697~0.862 **) and the average single potato weight (0.048~0.631). The tuber weight per plant was positively correlated with the plant height at the seedling stage (0.03~0.92 **) and positively correlated with the dry weight of stems and leaves at the tuber expansion stage and starch accumulation stage (0.74 **~0.95 **). It was negatively correlated with the number of branches at the tuber formation stage (−0.33~−0.88 **). Compared with CK, JG could significantly improve the water use efficiency of potatoes and reduce water consumption during the whole growth period of crops. In 2021, JG was 6.5% higher than CK, and HM was 6.88% lower than CK. In 2022, JG and HM increased water use efficiency by 26.17% and 14.50% compared with CK. When HM is applied in heavy soil areas, soil compaction can easily occur, which affects seedling emergence and reduces yield. At the same time, JG has strong adaptability to soil types and good yield stability. It can be seen that JG is a green and efficient mechanized potato cultivation technology suitable for dry farming areas.",15.0178561530708

Egypt is the largest and most dependent country on Nile water, with almost no rainfall. Groundwater is not renewable. Thus, the Nile water accounts for about 97% of Egypt's water resources and the share of the Egyptians is 55.5 billion m3, this quantity of water is insufficient to the needs of the population, and in order to maintain Egypt's per capita water, it needs about 80 billion m3, which means a deficit of 25 billion m3 and stability of Egypt's share of the Nile water under current local, regional and global conditions, and development of the appropriate strategy to alleviate the conflict with the basin countries Nile River so the study aimed to compare production efficiency and the economics of the irrigation systems used in the province of the lake through the study of water user associations in agriculture under the different irrigation patterns within water users association and outside association to rationalize the use of water and raising awareness to increase productivity. The results of the estimation indicated that the economic efficiency indicators of the maize and potato crop farmers in the sample of the field study show the preference of the use of the production function in the logarithmic formula to the different variables affecting the productivity of the crops according to the irrigation systems within the water user associations The results showed that the total production elasticity of maize crop was about 0.720, 0.530, 0.348 for sprinkler & drop, developed irrigation, and padded flooding systems, while the value of (R2) was about 0.76 , 0.60, 0.63  for irrigation systems respectively, The results showed that the total productivity of the potato crop was 1.127, 1.16, 1.318, for sprinkler & drop, developed irrigation, and padded flooding systems respectively, while the value of (R2) was about 0.76, 0.62, 0.70 for irrigation systems respectively. The relationship between the total costs and quantity produced of maize, which showed that the quadratic formula is the best formulas for the data, and the equations show that there is a statistically significant positive relationship between the total costs and production of maize in Behera Governorate. In the estimation of the optimal production volume, which reduces the costs is estimated at about 18.7, 22.1, 23.9 ardab/feddan, for sprinkler & drop, developed irrigation, and padded flooding systems respectively. In the estimation of the production volume which maximizes profit, the results showed that this volume was not reached, 29.1, 36.1, 31.9 ardab/feddan, for sprinkler & drop, developed irrigation, and padded flooding systems respectively. Calculating cost elasticity, it reached about 1.19, 0.804, 0.719, for sprinkler & drop, developed irrigation, and padded flooding systems respectively. In order to determine the optimal production volume of the potato crop, which reduces the costs, so make average cost equal marginal costs, estimated  at 12.539, 11.377, 11.064 tons/fed, for sprinkler & drop, developed irrigation, and padded flooding systems respectively. The size of production of potato that maximizes profit was about 42,500, 33.350, 25.600 tons/fed, for sprinkler & drop, developed irrigation, and padded flooding systems respectively. Calculating the cost elasticity of the potato, it turned out that it was about 0.93, 0.804, 0.719 for sprinkler & drop, developed irrigation, and padded flooding systems respectively.

The second scenario aims beside minimizing the water needs of cropping pattern, increasing export crop areas such as onions, peanuts, potatoes, tomatoes and other vegetables as much as possible, assuming situation stability of foreign trade.  The results of the analysis of the statistical models in the second scenario showed that the total quantity of irrigation water available for the cropping pattern was about 41.483 billion m3, while 38,471, 38.912, 38.803 billion m3 were used for the statistical models respectively, indicating that the required water quantities decreased by 3.013, 2.572, 2.681 billion m3, with a change rate of about 7.26, 6.20, 6.46%, for statistical models, respectively. The net return of the water unit for the actual cropping pattern was about 1.634 LE/m3, while it reached about 1.773, 1.830, 1.833 LE/m3 for the statistical models respectively, which shows the increase in the net return of water unit by 0.139, 0.197, 0.199 LE/m3, with a change rate of about 8.53, 12.04, 12.21%, for statistical models respectively.  Crop rotations can be applied to the new lands using water savings including (wheat and maize), with an area ranging from 2048 to 2399 thousand feddans, and including (wheat and summer and nili vegetables), with an area ranging from 2941 to 3444 thousand acres, also including (maize, winter and nili vegetables), with an area ranging from 3432 to 4021 thousand feddans. With regard to the impact of reducing the area of water crops to water gap which reached about 20.9 billion m3, it decreased by about 2.879, 2.758, 2.800 billion m3, which make water gap decreased to about 18.02, 18.14, 18.10 billion m3, with change rate of about 3.77, 3.61, 3.66%, for statistical models respectively, while the results of the second scenario show decreased of about 3.013, 2.572, 2.681 billion m3, which make water gap decreased to about 17.89, 18.33, 18.22 billion m3, with change rate of about 3.94, 3.37 and 3.51% for statistical models respectively. The research recommends the following points: 1. Reduce the areas of rice, sugar cane and alfalfa to save a quantity of water ranging between 2.572 - 3.013 billion m3 of land within the valley. 2. Using of water savings resulting from reducing the areas of water crops to expand the cultivation of new land with strategic and monetary crops. 3. Sugar beet area can be expanded at least to the extent that it covers the shortage of sugar production caused by reducing the sugar cane area, then taking into account and study the effects resulting from that. 4. Modification of cropping patern structure to be in accordance with the local, regional, environmental situations that may affect current and future water availability.","The research aimed to study the effect of reducing water voracious crop areas, such as (rice, sugar cane, bananas, alfalfa) on the available water quantity in the agricultural sector, where the data analysis showed that the most of the voracious crops especially rice and sugar cane are concentrated at the old lands within the valley as it explained in the research later, therefore, the research focused on inventory and analysis of the old land data within the valley to determine the best alternatives of the cropping pattern which achieves the state's goal of saving water and maximizing the return of the water unit, and is compatible with the current local, regional and environmental water conditions and the future developments that may occur in the future, that by using linear programming, through three models that have been formulated: the first is minimizing water requirement, the second model maximizes the net of acre return, while the third model maximizes the return of the water unit, using available data published and unpublished issued by the concerned authorities. The research focused mainly on the possibility of reducing the water needs of cropping pattern as a main objective, in addition to increasing the selfsufficiency ratios of strategic crops through the first scenario, and increasing the areas of export crops to increase the export proceeds through the second scenario, as far as possible within the available water and land area in the study area, using different statistical models. The results of the analysis of the statistical models in the first scenario showed that the total quantity of irrigation water available for the cropping pattern of the study crops reached 41.483 billion m3, while 38,604, 38.726, 38.683 billion m3 were used for the statistical models respectively, this indicates that the required water quantities decreased by 2.879, 2.758, 2.800 billion m3, with a change rate of about 6.94, 6.65, 6.75% for the statistical models, respectively. The net return of the water unit for the actual cropping pattern reached about 1.634 LE/m3, while it reached about 1.755, 1.767, 1.765 LE/m3 for the statistical models respectively, which shows the increase in net return of water unit by 0.122, 0.133, 0.131 LE/m3, with a change rate of about 7.46, 8.17, 8.05%, for statistical models respectively.

However, without unified water resources management policy to redistribute the saved agricultural water, farmers’ behavior will lead to water rebound and large-scale expansion of cultivated areas, especially on the edge of oasis regions. To solve these issues and promote the sustainable development of water resources, it makes sense to explore the impact of unified water resources management policy from the perspective of farmers’ behavior. This study takes the typical irrigation zone in the Heihe River Basin as a case to discuss the response of farmers’ economic behavior to transferring irrigation water and restricting land reclamation, i.e., the unified water resources management policy with the technical efficiency of crop irrigation improved based on the bio-economic model. The results show that in the case of loosening land constraints, farmers will reuse all the saved water for agricultural production by reclaiming unused land or increasing the area of water-intensive crops (vegetables). Although the policy of restricting land reclamation can restrict land expansion, it cannot avoid water rebound caused by adjusting the crop-planting structure. Farmers’ land-expansion behavior can be largely restricted by transferring the saved irrigation water to non-agricultural sectors in irrigation zones with inadequate water, but to contain land-expansion behavior in irrigation zones with surplus water, the policy of restricting land reclamation must be implemented simultaneously. The study also reveals that farmers will choose to grow more cash crops (seed maize, vegetables, tomato, seed watermelon, potato, and rapeseed) and fewer food crops (wheat, maize) to increase the profit per unit of water in the scenario of loosening land constraints or transferring agricultural water. Furthermore, the study indicates that farmers’ economic income can be decreased or at least not increased with the transfer of agricultural water. Both benefit compensation from non-agricultural sectors and increased non-agricultural income can compensate farmers’ economic loss. Therefore, it is necessary to improve water rights trading systems and increase employment opportunities for surplus agricultural labor to promote economic development in rural areas.","This provides insight into the current and future water situation in the East Nile Delta in Egypt. Additionally, the study aimed to identify gaps in knowledge that require further research and to illustrate the different types of models used to optimize water resources management and maintain food security.The study analyzed the status of water resources availability, water demand, and other influencing factors in the East Nile Delta. To address water scarcity, the study employed optimization models, specifically using linear optimization programming. This model was applied to the Eastern Delta area, focusing on the region supplied by the Ismailia Canal. The model aimed to balance the limited supply of freshwater with the increasing demand by proposing changes in cropping patterns.The study found that the best way to secure water supply and minimize water scarcity is by using optimization models. In the Eastern Delta, the area supplied by the Ismailia Canal had a water deficit of about 789.81 MCM. By changing the cropping patterns, the water deficit could be reduced. The results indicated a decrease in the cultivation of non-strategic crops such as onions, garlic, fruit trees, peanuts, sesame, and soybeans. Conversely, there was an increase in the cultivation of strategic crops such as wheat, cotton, maize, and corn, as well as crops with high net yields like tomatoes and potatoes. These changes would help balance water demand and supply, ensuring a more sustainable water management strategy for the future.","The direction of the country at this time is to applying an economic liberalization policy .

Bioenergy production and consumption can help sustain smallholders’ energy needs and generate employment and income, but it also raises concerns over social justice and equity, especially where crops used for bioenergy could also be used for food. This perspective paper is grounded in a literature review related to three different crops in Brazil: sugarcane, landrace maize and sweet potato. It seeks to determine if these crops offer the potential to support smallholder farmers’ development in a more equitable way, focusing on opportunities for their use in bioenergy. We review the literature to identify policies shaping the smallholder development context in relation to these crops, assessing whose knowledge informs policy and institutional decision making, and highlighting the policy attention afforded to the different crops from different sectors. We further evaluate the literature on each crop in relation to water use and calorific value (i.e., food and energy). Our review indicates that while sugarcane has received the most policy and institutional attention, its development is largely anchored in research and development investments that support large-scale commercial farms and agri-businesses. Smallholders have not benefited or had the opportunity to engage in relevant policy decision making for sugarcane cultivation. At the same time, smallholders hold valuable untapped knowledge on the cultivation of sweet potato and landrace maize, both of which have the potential to generate development opportunities for smallholders. Our review suggests that the environmental impact of landrace maize and sweet potato in terms of water use is significantly lower than sugarcane, while they can generate more calories for energy or food consumption and offer diversification opportunities. Despite that these alternative crops offer considerable untapped potential to support rural development, more research is still needed to harness these benefits. Changes are needed to address inequities in policies, institutions and the types of knowledge informing decision making. Such changes need to afford smallholder farmers greater recognition and participation in decision making, so that the distribution of benefits from the three study crops can reach them to support their development better.","A rapid development in economic sectors has induced the water depletion in most of the developing country, particularly for Malaysia. This study estimates the consumptive water use of cultivating 5 cash crops, i.e. cassava, maize, rice, sugarcane and sweet potato in Peninsular Malaysia. The consumptive water uses for cultivating these 5 crops was determined based on the CROPWAT 8.0 and Penman Monteith model. CROPWAT 8.0 model was used to compute the evapotranspiration and crop water requirement (effective rainfall and irrigation requirement) of the cash crops grown in Peninsular Malaysia from 2005-2013 (9 years). It was found that the green water uses for cultivating cassava, maize, paddy, sugarcane and sweet potato for Peninsular Malaysia is higher than the blue water use. In conclusion, water use for cultivating agricultural crops will accelerate the competition on the consumption of clean water with the other sectors. However, the availability of water resource in Peninsular Malaysia is sufficient to fulfil the demands for water at the present time.","Irrigation monitoring is of great importance in agricultural water management to guarantee better water use efficiency, especially under changing climatic conditions and water scarcity. This study presents a detailed assessment of the potential of the Sentinel-1 (S1) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data to detect irrigation events at the plot scale. The potential of the S1 data to detect the irrigation events was carried out using the Irrigation Event Detection Model (IEDM) over semi-arid and temperate oceanic climates in five study sites in south Europe and the Middle East. The IEDM is a decision tree model initially developed to detect irrigation events using the change detection algorithm applied to the S1 time series data. For each study site and at each agricultural plot, all available S1 images during the period of irrigation were used to construct an S1 time series and apply the IEDM. Different types of major summer irrigated crops were analyzed in this study, including Maize, Soybean, Sorghum and Potato, mainly with the sprinkler irrigation technique. The irrigation detection accuracy was evaluated using S1 images and the IEDM against the climatic condition of the studied area, the vegetation development (by means of the normalized difference vegetation index, NDVI) and the revisit time of the S1 sensor. The main results showed generally good overall accuracy for irrigation detection using the S1 data, reaching 67% for all studied sites together. This accuracy varied according to the climatic conditions of the studied area, with the highest accuracy for semi-arid areas and lowest for temperate areas. The analysis of the irrigation detection as a function of the crop type showed that the accuracy of irrigation detection decreases as the vegetation becomes well developed. The main findings demonstrated that the density of the available S1 images in the S1 time series over a given area affects the irrigation detection accuracy, especially for temperate areas. In temperate areas the irrigation detection accuracy decreased from 70% when 15 to 20 S1 images were available per month to reach less than 56% when less than 10 S1 images per month were available over the study sites.","Nowadays, nearly 90% of global water consumption is caused by irrigation activities, and more than 40% of the crops are produced under irrigated conditions. This study is an endeavour to estimate the irrigation water requirement (IWR) and crop water requirement (CWR) for some selected crops (Pepper, Eggplant, Potato, Soybean, Maize, Wheat Melon, Lettuce, Sunflower, Broadbean, Citrus, Cherry, Olive tree, Sugarbeet, Artichoke, Wine Grapes, Carrot...etc.) in Sothern Italy. The selected districts (Sant’ Arcangelo) have been taken as a case study area. Demanded meteorologically (rainfall, temperature, humidity, wind speed, sunshine hours) and crop data (crop coefficient and crop calendar) have been collected for 30 years period from 1981 to 2011. FAO CROPWATv8.0 software has been applied for requisite calculation of CWR and IWR along with the developing of cropping patterns. The FAO Penman-Monteith equation is used for estimating the reference evapotranspiration (ET0) by using meteorological data in the framework of CROPWAT model as it regarded as a good evaluator for a wide variety of climatic conditions. The analysis indicates that FAO Penman-Monteith suits very well for the study area and can be successfully used for the estimation of reference evapotranspiration. The important results in this study indicate that the IWR is very low from November to April (wintertime) due to higher rainfall intensity in these months and from month May to October a considerable amount of water is required for irrigation.","Agriculture is the major user of water resources, accounting for 70% of global freshwater demand. As the demand for clean water increases, so does the need to implement more efficient strategies for water management in irrigated agriculture. While the benefits of precision irrigation in high-value crops, such as cannabis, tomatoes, and potatoes, are fully recognized, there is still need to investigate and implement cheap and efficient irrigation strategies for widespread low-value crops such as maize. In this study, the soil moisture dynamics in a sprinkler-irrigated maize field in Veneto (Northeastern Italy) was monitored using six time domain reflectometry (TDR) probes for the entire growing season. The TDR sensors were positioned at different depths into two separate sites: an Uninformed Site irrigated based on the farmer's experience and an Informed Site in which a water balance irrigation strategy was applied based on soil moisture measurements. A parsimonious hydrological model was then implemented and calibrated to quantify the different water balance terms (precipitation, evapotranspiration, lateral fluxes, and deep percolation). The comparison between the water budget terms in the two sites highlights that soil moisture monitoring during agriculture activities leads to substantial savings in terms of irrigation water volumes requirements and cost, without compromising the productivity of the crop field. A simplified upscaling of the results at the regional scale, assuming average conditions as in this study site and growing season, reveals that potentially significant economic savings, compared to the total profits linked to maize crops, could be possible.",20.2812771427725

The objective of this study was to assess farmers’ perception, production constraints, preferences, and breeding priorities of sweetpotato in selected agro-ecologies of Rwanda. A total of 495 farmers were surveyed in 2013 in eight representative districts: Bugesera and Kayonza in the Eastern Province, Gakenke and Rulindo in the Northern Province, and Gisagara, Huye, and Muhanga in the Southern Province. Data were collected through a participatory rural appraisal (PRA) methodology using a semistructured questionnaire and focus group discussions. Pairwise comparison of 16 food crops allocated sweetpotato as one of the five important food crops for food security and income generation. Drought stress, unavailability of improved cultivars and planting material, and pest and disease damage were perceived to be the five main constraints limiting sweetpotato production, contributing to 17.3%, 15.0%, 12.9%, 11.7%, and 11.5%, respectively. The most important sweetpotato cultivar traits had high yield, early maturity, drought tolerance, disease and pest tolerance, and good culinary taste at 22.5%, 18.5%, 15.4%, 12.7%, and 10.1%, respectively. The characteristics of good storage roots identified by farmers included high dry matter content, good culinary taste, good shape, root size, and sweetness representing 27.4%, 18.8%, 16.1%, 11.6%, and 9.4%, respectively. Each agro-ecological zone has its own specific sweetpotato production constraints and farmers’ preferences, necessitating targeted breeding of different sweetpotato cultivars for each agro-ecological zone for enhanced productivity and successful adoption of cultivars. Globally the demand for quantity and quality food is fast increasing as a result of population growth, limited water and land, and overexploitation of available resources (Godfray et al., 2010; Tilman et al., 2001). Moreover, global climate change aggravates the biotic and abiotic stresses on food crops (Tester and Langridge, 2010). These environmental changes will negatively affect crop production and food security. Therefore, novel mitigation strategies are required to boost crop productivity and ensure food security. Improved and resilient crop cultivars and their production technologies are among these strategies (Brown and Funk, 2008). Participatory plant breeding is usually conducted to ensure adoption of newly developed crop cultivars and their production packages by smallholder farmers of marginal agro-ecological and socioeconomic groups (Ceccarelli et al., 2007). In the past, plant breeding focused on developing high-yielding and improved crop cultivars in favorable environments and under controlled experimental situations (Bänziger and Cooper, 2001). As such, conventional plant breeding did not consider farmers’ preferences and attributes, locally available germplasm, and the real conditions of small-scale farmers in pursuit of developing crop cultivars for broad adaptation (Ceccarelli et al., 2000; Witcombe et al., 1996). These failures to engage with the realities faced by local farmers have been identified as the primary causes for the consistently low adoption of newly developed ‘‘improved’’ crop cultivars and their production packages released by government and NGO scientists (Adesina and Baidu-Forson, 1995). There are varied preferences and needs by end users for crop cultivars. For instance, for industrial starch production, sweetpotato cultivars are required to have high dry matter content, whereas cultivars for human consumption should have other traits such as attractive skin and flesh color, good cooking quality, and high b-carotene, among others. Sweetpotato cultivars intended for animal feed should have high protein content (Lebot, 2009). Therefore, sweetpotato breeding should involve the needs of stakeholders in the developing of new cultivars and new agricultural technologies to meet their diverse requirements (Atlin et al., 2001; Rees et al., 2003). Agricultural technologies developed through participatory research have a greater chance of adoption and diffusion by farmers because they are developed in response to local constraints and meet end users’ needs and preferences (Ashby and Lilja, 2004). Various research approaches have been reported in participatory breeding of new crop cultivars, including consultative approaches, collaborative approaches, collegial approaches, and farmer experimentation (Ashby and Lilja, 2004). Advantages of farmer participatory research include: 1) codefinition of breeding objectives; 2) participatory evaluation of germplasm; 3) identification of breeding priorities; and 4) participatory selection of promising progenies (Ceccarelli and Grando, 2009). In one case, the incorporation of participatory approaches into conventional breeding programs reduced the time taken for cultivar development from 9 to 6 years (Lilja and Aw-Hasaan, 2003). In sweetpotato breeding, farmers’ knowledge and experience during preliminary on-farm and on-station evaluations may enable quick identification of promising genotypes (Abidin et al., 2005). Song (1998) reported that the end users’ participation in the improvement of seed systems led to the efficient use of national genetic resources and promoted their production. In selection of high-yielding genotypes, Ceccarelli et al. (2009) observed that farmers have the same selection ability as breeders. Therefore, close collaboration between farmers and breeders is necessary to speed up the breeding process and to respond to appropriate needs of stakeholders. Application of participatory research requires integrated skills (Ceccarelli et al., 2009). A careful choice of research goals, target environments, and selection of partners are critical steps of participatory research. It also demands a systematic understanding of different types of participatory research approaches to select the most appropriate tools (Ashby and Lilja, 2004) such as participatory rural appraisal, focus group discussions, participatory selection in segregating populations, and participatory cultivar testing and selection (Sperling et al., 2001). Sweetpotato is an important food and feed crop in sub-Sahara Africa and ranks fourth after maize, bananas, and cassava (FAOSTAT, 2013). It yields considerably well in poor soils and tolerates extreme weather conditions unsuitable to other food crops such as maize and banana (Woolfe, 1992). Therefore, it has an important role in food security in many Received for publication 24 Sept. 2014. Accepted for publication 18 Nov. 2014.

Rwanda is the third in sweetpotato production in East Africa and the first in per-capita consumption of sweetpotato in Africa (Chassy et al., 2008). More than 95% of Rwandan farmers grow sweetpotato for household food security (Njeru et al., 2008). During the farming seasons many rural families rely on sweetpotato because of a shortage of other food security crops such as cassava, potato, banana, and maize (Gibson et al., 2004; Njeru et al., 2008). As a result of its high productivity per unit area and continuous availability, sweetpotato is an ideal food crop for Rwanda, the most densely populated (416 persons/km) country in Africa, with limited agricultural land (NISR, 2012). The crop requires less production inputs such as fertilizers and pesticides than other major crops (Woolfe, 1992). However, the average sweetpotato yield in Rwanda is low, 5.9 t·ha wet weight compared with yields of 22.8 and 21.7 t·ha reported in the United States and Japan, respectively (FAOSTAT, 2013). This requires targeted participatory sweetpotato breeding to develop improved and highyielding cultivars, and their production packages, according to the needs of the growers in the country. Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess farmers’ perception, production and productivity constraints, preferences, and breeding priorities of sweetpotato in selected agro-ecologies of Rwanda. Results of the study may assist in the breeding and sustainable production of sweetpotato in Rwanda and countries with similar agro-ecologies. Materials and Methods Description of the study areas. The study was carried out in 2013 in Bugesera and Kayonza districts of Eastern Province, Gakenke and Rulindo districts of Northern Province, and Gisagara, Huye, and Muhanga districts of the Southern Province of Rwanda (Fig. 1). These districts were selected because of the importance of sweetpotato production in their food production (Ndamage et al., 1992). Agriculture is the main economic activity of the selected districts, employing more than 90% of the population. In these districts farmers grow many food crops including beans, sorghum, sweetpotato, bananas, and maize (NISR, 2010). The Rwanda Agricultural Board (RAB) has promoted cultivation of sweetpotato in these areas to produce raw material for the Urwibutso Enterprise, which was established for the industrial production of sweetpotato biscuits, cakes, bread, and juice (Rwakabuba, 2012). In Gisagara, Huye, and Muhanga districts, a range of food crops is grown, including sweetpotato, which is the main food crop supplied to provincial cities (Kayitare, 2006). Sampling method. A multistage sampling was used for the study. Two sectors in each district were sampled. In each sector two villages were subsampled and six to eight farmers wer","The infl uence of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) (two Peruvian mixed iso- lates, a pure isolate of Glomus intraradices) and the fl avonoid, formononetin, were tested on growth, yield, and leaf elemental concentration of the Peruvian potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) 'Yungay'. Plants started from tissue culture-produced prenuclear minitubers of 'Yun- gay' were subjected to seven treatments, which included noncolonized (non-AMF) plants fertilized with Long Ashton nutrient solution modifi ed to supply P at 11 and 44 µg·mL -1 . All AMF plants received low P (11 µg·mL -1 ) and were inoculated with either a sierra-maize mixed isolate, sierra-papa mixed isolate, pure isolate of G. intraradices, sierra-maize mixed isolate + formononetin, or a sierra-papa mixed isolate + formononetin. Plants were grown in 3-L containers under shade house conditions in Lima, Peru. Non-AMF plants at low P had the poorest growth, while high P plants had the greatest overall growth. All AMF plants had greater growth, including a higher root to shoot ratio, higher phosphorus use effi ciency ((g tuber)/(g P/kg tissue)), and a lower leaf to tuber ratio (indicating greater leaf effi ciency in producing tuber dry matter), compared to non-AMF plants at low P. The mycorrhizal inoculation effect (MIE) ranged from +44% to +57%, indicating that 'Yungay' was mod- erately to highly mycorrhizal dependent. Plants colonized with the sierra-papa isolate + formononetin had the same tuber development and leaf to tuber ratio, compared to high P, non-AMF plants. Formononetin increased extraradical hyphae formation. Mycorrhizal enhancement was in part due to greater P, Fe, and Mg uptake, a higher phosphorus-use effi ciency and greater extraradical hyphae formation. vegetable crops, i.e., its N, P, and K require- ments are respectively 100%, 100%, and 33% greater than that required for tomato or pepper plant production (Maynard and Hochmuth, 1997). Normal fertilizer applications are around 1000 kg·ha -1 of 10-30-10 (10N-12.9P-8.3K). Subsistence growers may not have access or be able to afford suitable organic or inorganic fertil- izers. Modern sustainable agriculture systems are increasingly using reduced fertility inputs. Hence, there are excellent opportunities to in- corporate arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) as biofertilizers to enhance crop productivity and reduce fertilizer inputs. AMF increase nutrient and water uptake, alleviate cultural and environmental stresses and enhance disease resistance and plant health (Bethlenfalvay and Linderman, 1992; Davies, et al., 1993, 1996; Pfl eger and Linderman, 1994). AMF can enhance productivity of potatoes (Gra- ham et al., 1976; Niemira et al., 1995). In part this may be due to enhanced nutrient uptake of potato plants, particularly P (Black and Tinker, 1977; McArther and Knowles, 1993), as well as enhanced disease resistance (Niemira et al., 1996). In Columbia, experiments show that a considerable amount of P fertilizer can be saved when potatoes are inoculated with effective AMF (Sieverding, 1991). The highlands of Peru and Bolivia are the center of origin and diversity of the cultivated potato. Potato is the main staple crop in the highlands and accounts for 63% gross value of all crop production (Devaux et al., 1997). Average potato yields are very low (from 5 to 8 t·ha -1","World poverty and hunger are closely related toenvironmental degradation, caused by increasingpopulation pressure and urban expansions, soilerosion, limitation of water resources, gaseouspollution, and massive industrialization.Furthermore, climate changes and extreme weatherpatterns pose new challenges for crop productionand food security. Sustainable agriculture for theproduction of food and fiber, usingenvironmentally-conscious farming practices basedon understanding plant ecological interactions, iscrucial for the preservation of natural resources forfuture generations.This special issue focuses on recent researchprogress on understanding plant interaction withabiotic and biotic stress factors for sustainableagriculture. Plant stresses inflected by salinity,drought, floods, temperature extremes, radiation,and toxic substances deposited in the soil togetherwith diseases and insects attacks, are the majorlimitations of crop cultivation incurring substantialreduction in yield and hence elevate economiclosses to the farmers.Sustainable agriculture is challenged by thelosses in crop genetic diversity. Conservation ofavailable germplasm and the efficient utilization ofgenetic resources are important aspects of currentresearch. In this special issue, Yumurtaci (2015)reviewed the utilization of wild relatives for thedevelopment of abiotic and biotic stress tolerantnew varieties of four major food crops includingwheat, barley, maize and oat.Modern advances in biotechnology offerinnovative approaches for understanding thefundamental mechanisms of abiotic and bioticstress and the development of stress tolerant crops.On this topic, Bakhsh (2015) reviewed currentresearch achievements towards the development ofabiotic stress tolerant crops through geneticengineering. In addition, Ram and Sharma (2015)studied the molecular characterization of TaPase inwheat, a gene known to be involved in plantresponse to stress.Plant diseases represent another major challengefor sustainable agriculture. To illustrate theimportance of integrating genetic engineering in thestrategies to combat plant diseases, Elayabalan etal. (2015) reviewed relevant advances in thedevelopment of banana plants resistant to thebanana bunchy top disease.Moreover, crop plants must adapt to adverseclimatic conditions, particularly those associatedwith the global climatic changes. Stresses due toabiotic stress factors like drought, extremetemperature and salinity and heavy metal toxicityinflect tremendous losses in crop productivity andare considered as major challenging factors forfuture agriculture sustainability. This topic wasaddressed in this special issue in several papers.Ud-Din et al. (2015) addressed drought effect onrice yield in relation to hormonal application.Siddika et al. (2015) studied the response to hightemperature stress of Basella alba, a leaf vegetablecommonly names as vine spinach.On the topic of heavy metal toxicity, Fasahat(2015) reviewed progress made in understandingcadmium toxicity and tolerance in rice.

Technical development, climate change, and changing consumer needs, including the detection of GMOs, necessitate the innovation of plant variety testing methods. In our study, we assessed new characters, testing methods, and inclusion of additional data for the potential to benefit the DUS and VCU protocols. To achieve our goal, we asked experts to fill in questionnaires for the DUS and VCU methods currently used for a selection of common crops, including potato, maize, lentil, oilseed rape, and perennial grass. Within the EU-funded “InnoVar” project, partners sent out questionnaires to 19 European Countries and to 3 countries outside Europe. Surveys were aimed at analyzing the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) of the current methods. With their help, it is possible to look for a new direction, opportunity, and strategy to incorporate, together with the innovative new techniques, into the development of the new methods. Our study demonstrated that the SWOT analysis could be used to achieve the set goals. Results obtained after evaluation of surveys confirmed that introduction of new characters such as cold tolerance, nitrogen and water efficiency, etc. has become necessary, as has the inclusion of new test methods (molecular markers, precision techniques, organic farming). The development of high-yielding, disease and/or pest-resistant plant varieties with good adaptability and the accurate evaluation of genotypes play a crucial role in ensuring that farmers can access high-performing plant varieties and contribute to sustainable food production.","Under drought stress, plants have developed various mechanisms to survive in the reduced water supply, of which the regulation of stress-related gene expression is responsible for several transcription factors. The basic leucine zippers (bZIPs) are one of the largest and most diverse transcription factor families in plants. Among the 10 Arabidopsis bZIP groups, group A bZIP transcription factors function as a positive or negative regulator in ABA signal transduction and drought stress response. These bZIP transcription factors, which are involved in the drought response, have also been isolated in various plant species such as rice, pepper, potato, and maize. Recent studies have provided substantial evidence that many bZIP transcription factors undergo the post-translational modifications, through which the regulation of their activity or stability affects plant responses to various intracellular or extracellular stimuli. This review aims to address the modulation of the bZIP proteins in ABA signaling and drought responses through phosphorylation, ubiquitination and sumoylation.","Brand loyalty is regularly categorised as one of the most vital drivers for ensuring the long-term sustainability of any organisation. Advantages of having a brand loyal customer base include lower sensitivity to price increases, lower brand switching intentions, high level of customer word-of-mouth marketing exposure and increased consumer profitability. The main focus of this study is to measure the brand loyalty of the KwaZulu-Natal consumers towards their uncooked chicken brand of choice using a validated model and its measuring instrument. The model was developed to measure brand loyalty in the fastmoving consumer goods industry but also successfully applied in agriculture, financial services and other industries. The model measures twelve of the most important antecedents influencing brand loyalty, namely perceived value, brand relevance, brand trust, repeat purchase, switching cost, brand affect, brand commitment, involvement, brand performance, relationship proneness, customer satisfaction and culture. The empirical study was conducted amongst 112 consumers in the KwaZulu-Natal Province of South Africa. A convenience sample was used to collect data through a product-specific adapted questionnaire designed to test how strongly each of the twelve antecedents relates to KwaZulu-Natal’s consumer loyalty towards its chicken brand. The sample showed the appropriate adequacy, had low sphericity and were proved to be reliable as measured by Cronbach Alpha coefficients. The empirical results confirm the importance of each brand loyalty antecedent in chicken brands. This study offers the most important brand loyalty antecedents as a managerial guideline to chicken brands for consideration to implement in their customer loyalty marketing strategies.

Agriculture has the most possibilities compared to the other two sectors. Furthermore, agriculture and agroprocessing are anticipated to create at least one million jobs by 2030. The South African agricultural sector is also vital regarding their role in food security, rural development and poverty alleviation (Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, 2017:8). Employment in the agricultural segment increased by 5% to 849 000 employees in the third to last quarter of 2017 (Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, 2017:9). South African agriculture is confronted by increasing costs of production attributed largely to the high prices of inputs (fertilisers, seed and pesticides), electricity, fuel, mechanisation and labour. There are also additional challenges like frequent drought spells and outbreaks of pests and diseases. In the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries’ Annual Report for 2016/2017, Minister Zokwana said that the government initiated and funded drought-relief programmes worth R263 million. This followed the 2016 season was classified as one of the worst droughts the country has experienced since 1904 (Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, 2017:13). Journal of Business and Retail Management Research (JBRMR), Vol. 14 Issue 1 October 2019 www.jbrmr.com A Journal of the Centre for Business & Economic Research (CBER) 80 The regulatory agricultural environment has also changed dramatically since the onset of democracy in 1994. Government subsidies have been discontinued and commercial farmers are now more price sensitive. In addition to the rising farm expenditure, and specifically labour costs regulated by the minimum wage legislation, farming activities shifted towards mechanisation and the use of capital intensive buying behaviour of farmers (Grainger, 2018). On the political front, the announcement of President Cyril Ramaphosa in December 2017 at the ruling party’s conference that Land Expropriation without Compensation was going to be phased in after the Election in 2019, are a major concern for farmers. This, in conjunction with continued pressure on land reform from Julius Malema, leader of the opposing Economic Freedom Front party, have increased uncertainty in farming (The South African, 2019). Furthermore, the uncertain safety situation on farms and high volume of farm attacks (108) and murders (57.4%) (for the period March 2017 to March 2018) also have a negatively influence farm investments (Head, 2018). As a result, investment and capital expenditure in farming is limited because farmers are unsure of their fate in the future (Bisschoff & Grainger, 2019:4). The Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (2018:10) also reported that the agricultural sector succeeded to contribute 2.4% to the Gross Domestic Product in 2017. The total worth of agricultural production for 2017 was valued at R277,6 billion; this is 8,4% higher than the previous year. The total worth of animal products contributed R137 billion, contributing nearly 50% to the overall agricultural value (Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, 2018:12). The Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries is continuously aiming to implement strategies to expand the sector. Table 1 below shows some of the focus areas and accompanying forecasts of expansion in the agricultural sector. Table 1: Expansion of the Agricultural Sector Focus Area From 2012 To Increase number of Agricultural Smallholders 171,670 471,670 (2019) Increase value-added activities of sectors R42.5 billion R48.9 billion (2019) Increase the average value of annual exports R5.1 billion R5.8 billion (2019) The decrease in the average value of annual imports of diesel, fertiliser and machinery R9.6 billion R7.4 billion (2019) Increase the number of jobs in the sector 660,000 1 million (2030) The ZAR traded at $14,87 US Agriculture in the KwaZulu-Natal province Agriculture has always been a major contributor to KwaZulu-Natal’s economy, especially as KwaZulu-Natal is reckoned to be South Africa’s best watered province and boasting 6.5 million hectares of high-quality agricultural land. The area between Pietermaritzburg and the Drakensberg, known as the Midlands, is regarded as the heart of the province’s agricultural area. The North Coast region is another area of importance where several national leading agricultural products are produced. Some 82% of the province’s agricultural land is fit for extensive livestock production, while 18% of this region have arable land. Even though KwaZulu-Natal covers a small portion of South African borders, a substantial proportion of the nation's small-scale farmers are based here. The diversity of the province’s agriculture is also of note and relates to the patterns of the province’s topography. KwaZulu-Natal has specialist capabilities in several agricultural products as a result of its decent and reliable rainfall throughout the year and its fertile soils (KwaZulu-Natal Top Business, 2018). The main focus of KwaZulu-Natal’s agricultural sector consists of the following: • Horticulture: Sub-tropical fruits, especially bananas, pineapples, cashew nuts, potatoes and other vegetables. • Crops: Sugar and maize • Forestry: Black wattle, SA pine, eucalyptus, saligna and poplar. • Animal husbandry: poultry, beef, sheep (mutton and wool) and pigs (KwaZulu-Natal Top Business, 2018). Problem statement The South African uncooked chicken market, consisting of chicken pieces and also whole birds, is affected by feed cost that have increased significantly. The cost of feeding a chicken has increased by 157% Journal of Business and Retail Management Research (JBRMR), Vol. 14 Issue 1 October 2019 www.jbrmr.com A Journal of the Centre for Business & Economic Research (CBER) 81 from 2001 to 2012, while the selling price of a chicken remains under pressure due to cheap imports. During the same period, chicken prices have risen by only 61% (Davids et al., 2015:73). To survive and remain competitive, South African chicken producers are forced to continuously improve on efficiency and constantly generating new competitive strategies to attract new customers and maintain their current customer base (Esterhuizen, 2006:1). One such strategy is to effectively brand chicken products and target the different brands to specific market segments to acquiring a competitive advantage by creating a brand loyal customer base (Jandaghi et al., 2011:153). Kyriakidis and Rach (2010:7) among many other strategist’s state that there are many advantages in creating brand loyal customers. One such advantage is that such customers are usually less sensitive to price escalations of and loyal customers are also prepared to pay a premium price to obtain their brand of choice. By creating a strong brand and loyal customers, brand management can become a strategic thrust toward profitability. However, to effectively manage a brand and its loyalty, management must measure the levels of brand management across several key brand loyalty indicators (Moolla and Bisschoff, 2012a:342). This is where the problem in the chicken industry lies. There is no tailor-made model to measure brand loyalty in the chicken industry. This study then proposes to address the above problem by using a South African brand loyalty model developed for the fast-moving consumer goods industry, to measure the brand loyalty of uncooked chicken brands in KwaZulu-Natal. Objectives of the study 1. The primary objective of this study will be to measure the brand loyalty of KwaZulu-Natal consumers towards their chicken brand. 2. The secondary objectives are to: 3. Confirm the statistical validity of the twelve brand loyalty antecedents; 4. Measure the brand loya","Haber’s invention of the synthesis of ammonia from its elements is one of the cornerstones of modern civilization. For nearly a century, agriculture has come to rely on synthetic nitrogen fertilizers produced from ammonia. This large-scale production is now supporting nearly half of the world’s population through increased food production. But whilst the use of synthetic nitrogen fertilizers brought enormous benefits, including those of the Green Revolution, the world needs to disengage from our ever-increasing reliance on nitrogen fertilizers produced from fossil fuels. Their pollution of the atmosphere and water systems has become a major global environmental and economic concern. Naturally, legume crops such as peas and beans can fix nitrogen symbiotically by interacting with soil nitrogen-fixing rhizobia, bacteria that become established intracellularly within root nodules. Ever since this was first demonstrated in 1888, consistent attempts have been made to extend the symbiotic interaction of legumes with nitrogen-fixing bacteria to non-legume crops, particularly cereals. In 1988, a fresh impetus arose from the discovery of Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus (Gd), a non-nodulating, non-rhizobial, nitrogen-fixing bacterium isolated from the intercellular juice of sugarcane. Subsequently, strains of Gd inoculated under specific conditions were shown to intracellularly colonize the roots and shoots of the cereals: wheat, maize (corn) and rice, as well as crops as diverse as potato, tea, oilseed rape, grass and tomato. An extensive field trials programme using a seed inoculum technology based on Gd (NFix®) indicates that NFix® is able to significantly improve yields of wheat, maize, oilseed rape and grasses, in both the presence and absence of synthetic nitrogen fertilizers. Evidence suggests that these benefits are accruing through a possible combination of intracellular symbiotic nitrogen fixation, enhanced rates of photosynthesis and the presence of additional plant growth factors. Here, we discuss the research events that have led to this important development and present results demonstrating the efficacy of NFix® technology in non-legume crops, in particular cereals.","The root is an important plant organ, which uptakes nutrients and water from the soil, and provides anchorage for the plant. Abiotic stresses like heat, drought, nutrients, salinity, and cold are the major problems of potato cultivation. Substantial research advances have been achieved in cereals and model plants on root system architecture (RSA), and so root ideotype (e.g., maize) have been developed for efficient nutrient capture to enhance nutrient use efficiency along with genes regulating root architecture in plants. However, limited work is available on potatoes, with a few illustrations on root morphology in drought and nitrogen stress. The role of root architecture in potatoes has been investigated to some extent under heat, drought, and nitrogen stresses. Hence, this mini-review aims to update knowledge and prospects of strengthening RSA research by applying multi-disciplinary physiological, biochemical, and molecular approaches to abiotic stress tolerance to potatoes with lessons learned from model plants, cereals, and other plants.","Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) ranks fourth following wheat, rice and maize worldwide. Population growth in this world possesses a serious concern with regard to natural resources i.e. land, air and water. Following this, potato holds guarantee aimed at nourishment to a great many individuals particularly in developing nations. Maximum capacity of the yield can be acknowledged just if pests and diseases are monitored. Potato yield can be influenced by roughly 160 diseases and disorders of which 50, 10 and 40 are caused by fungi, bacterial and viral infections, respectively and others by nonparasitic, or because of obscure causes. These may influence potato at any phase of harvest development or not withstanding amid capacity. They may influence foliage, tubers or both. Condition favouring pathogens can demolish the harvest.
